``You are playing an ``open world'' game, something like Grand Theft Auto or Skyrim.
Instead of going straight to the next mission objective in the city you are in,
you decide to drive (or ride) five hours in some randomly chosen direction.
The game makes up the landscape as you go along, and you end up in a new city that no human player has visited before.
In this city, you can enter any house (though you might have to pick a few locks), talk to everyone you meet,
and involve yourself in a completely new set of intrigues and carry out new missions.
If you would have gone in a different direction, you would have reached a different city
with different architecture, different people and different missions.
Or a huge forest with realistic animals and eremites, or a secret research lab, or whatever the game engine comes up with.''
