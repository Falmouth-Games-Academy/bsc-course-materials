\part{The Meta-Game}
\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Games Meta-Game}
	
	Setup:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Self-organise into groups of 3-4 players
		\item You will each receive two sets of card: game cards and question cards.
		\item While you are waiting for your cards, identify the youngest player. They will be the first critic.
		\item All actions are clockwise from the critic.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Games Meta-Game}
	
	Instructions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	\textbf{Question}: The critic draws a question card. 
		\item 	\textbf{Answer}: The \textit{remaining players} (i.e., not the critic!) submit their best game card, to answer the question, face-up.
		\item 	\textbf{Justification}: The \textit{remaining players} justify the game card they have selected.
		\item 	\textbf{Selection}: The critic selects the most suitable game card answering the question. That player `wins' the round, keeping the question card as a scoring token
			and becomes the next critic.	
		\item 	\textbf{Repeat} from step 1, for approximately 20 minutes.	
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
   
\part{Careers in the Games Industry}
\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	It is important to note that:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Games are complex and therefore require significant knowledge and skills to produce \pause
		\item They bring together art, storytelling, design and computing \pause
		\item Roles are therefore quite diverse and specialised \pause
		\item Each role requires very specific skills, mastered in considerable depth \pause
		\item Teamwork is essential (though there are many ways of working)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	Computing professionals tend to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deal with the technical side of games development \pause
		\item Be specialists, consultants, analysts, or technical leaders \pause
		\item Be people who are comfortable with mathematics and science \pause
		\item Keep up with the fast-paced field of computer technology \pause
		\item Have a science degree rather than an arts degree, with an ability to conduct independent research
		\item Experts in programming and software engineering
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	There is a wide range of technical roles in game studios:
	
	\begin{columns}
		\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Technical Director / CTO / Lead
				\item Gameplay Programmer
				\item Engine Programmer
				\item Physics Programmer
				\item AI Programmer
				\item Network Programmer
				\item Graphics Programmer
			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Tools Programmer
				\item UX / UI Programmer
				\item Middleware / Technology Developer
				\item Porting Programmer
				\item Level Scripter
				\item Audio Engineer
				\item Data Scientist
			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}
	\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What About Other Careers?}
	
	Naturally, your degree does not pre-determine your career path:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	\textbf{Design}: designers who can actually prototype their designs can test their designs and quickly become better at designing \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Art}: art for digital games is indeed digital and technical artists are in high demand \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Management}: insight into how software developers practice their craft will make you better at managing them in a studio context 
			(and perhaps even garner some respect) \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Administration \& Commerce}: the games industry isn't just about development, there is a huge range of other career paths,
			such as human resources and IT
	\end{itemize}

	This module is designed to introduce you to the basic principles of computing and programming in the context of digital games.
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	Your learning will complement the other modules through providing a broad foundation on the different methods and techniques which will help you to be able to construct computer programs and able to use relevant scholarly sources. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP120: Tinkering}
	
	This module is designed to help you learn different ways of engaging with code using practical and exploratory methods. 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	You will learn the value of taking a creative approach to computing and become acquainted with some of the principles behind Creative Computing. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP150: Game Dev Practice}
	
	This module introduces you to the founding principles and processes of professional game development. 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	You gain an understanding of the way that the different components of game development come together to make playable games and how those components are organised through the development pipeline. You also gain a `first-principles' understanding of how games are designed with a target market in mind and have a strong underlying concept.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP130: Game Architecture}
	
	This module helps you to understand the ways in which the architecture of games shape the types of computing solutions that one might build. 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	Your contextual understanding of game architecture is then brought into sharper focus practically through practical worksheet and research tasks.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP140: Hacking}
	
	The module allows you to develop further a creative approach to computing within the context of building solutions used to develop games. 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	You will begin to bring different elements together, taking existing code from multiple sources and learn ways and methods for bringing these together in synthesis in order to build more creative and robust solutions. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP160: Software Engineering}
	
	This module helps you build on your experience of game development by engaging in depth with the principles of professional software engineering. 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	You will learn the importance of reuse and scalability when creating solutions and how to identify recurring problems within a specific domain. You'll demonstrate this both by applying existing design patterns and by creating your own reusable solutions.
