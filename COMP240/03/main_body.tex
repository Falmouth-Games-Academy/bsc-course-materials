\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Learning Outcomes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Distinguish} between primary and secondary research
		\item \textbf{Outline} the importance of research ethics \textbf{and} professional conduct
		\item \textbf{Assess} the quality of secondary sources of market data and information
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Discussion: What Is Research?}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What do you understand by the term ‘research’?
		\item What distinguishes business and management research from scientific research, more generally? 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	In groups of 3-6:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Briefly, \textbf{discuss} potential answers to these questions with your peers
		\item \textbf{Sketch} how \textit{you see} research
		\item \textbf{Explain} your sketch to your peers
	\end{itemize}
	
	(15 minutes)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Why Do Research?}
	
	Research provides you with the knowledge needed to make important decisions. This empowers you to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reduce risk and maximise rewards before committing to a course of action
		\item Prioritise actions that are likely to lead to the highest yield and/or greatest impact
		\item Avoid known pitfalls---don't repeat disasters
		\item Understand how to apply a course of action effectively
		\item Minimise wastage of resources
		\item Self-evaluate and improve the effectiveness of future actions
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Effective Research}
	
	To be effective, business-orientated research should follow the standard of the scientific method:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Purpose is clearly defined
		\item Research method is sufficiently detailed
		\item Research design is rigorously planned and appropriate
		\item Limitations clearly stated
		\item High ethical standards applied
		\item Adequate analysis for decision maker's needs
		\item Unambiguous presentation
		\item Justified and well-defended conclusions
		\item Reflects upon the authority and eminence of the researcher
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Primary vs Secondary}
	
	When we conduct research, we can either:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Apply research methods ourselves to collect new data (primary source of data)
		\item Use existing data provided by other researchers (secondary source of data)
	\end{itemize}
	
	Most research will involve a combination of \textit{primary} and \textit{secondary} sources
	
\end{frame}

	\frametitle{Research Ethics}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ethic --- ``A body of moral principles or values''
		\item Ethical --- ``of or pertaining to ethics''
		\item Ethics --- ``a system of moral principles''
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	Think back to Forsyth's taxonomy of ethical ideologies and his principles.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Research Ethics}
	
	Research involving people is premised on a fundamental moral commitment 
	to advancing human welfare, 
	knowledge, and understanding, and to examining cultural dynamics

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Research Ethics: Why}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Historically, human participants have not been well-protected from researchers
		\item Need to protect people from dangerous and naiive research practices
		\item Conflicts of interest (i.e., financial gain, big business)
		\item Monitoring of controversial issues (e.g., gene editing with CRISPR)
		\item Privacy and data protection
		\item Promoting high quality research
	\end{itemize}
