\begin{frame}{The plan}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Represent the player's \textbf{position} by a 3D vector
		\pause\item Represent the player's \textbf{orientation} by Euler angles
		\pause\item Mouse events change these angles
		\pause\item View matrix is calculated using position and orientation
		\pause\item To move forwards, use the Euler angles to find the ``forward'' vector,
			and offset the position by this vector
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Keyboard and mouse in SDL}
	\pause Use \textbf{relative mouse mode}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Hides the mouse pointer
		\pause\item Prevents the mouse pointer from hitting the edge of the screen
		\pause\item Gives us the distance the mouse has moved since last frame, rather than its current position
	\end{itemize}
	\pause Use \lstinline{SDL_GetKeyboardState} instead of handling individual keyboard events
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Allows us to check on every frame whether the key is held down
		\pause\item Otherwise, the player will move jerkily according to the key repeat rate
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
