\begin{frame}{Writing Efficient GPU Code}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Same key principles apply as for CPU code!
		\pause\item Certain operations are optimised in GLSL, eg. swizzling, built-in functions for linear interpolation, dot product etc.
		\pause\item Write as much as possible in the vertex shader - remember there are fewer vertices than pixels!
		\pause\item As always: base your changes on profiling results...
