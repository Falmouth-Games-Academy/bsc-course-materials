\begin{frame}{What is Post-Processing?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Is a series of techniques that are carried out after a scene has been rendered
		\pause\item Traditionally this could only be done as an offline process
		\pause\item With the advent of faster GPUs and programmable shaders, we could implement some of the effects in real time
		\pause\item The key to the effect is to switch from drawing to the back buffer to a texture
		\pause\item This texture will contain the scene
		\pause\item We then use a shader to implement a post-processing effect
		\pause\item We then map the processed texture onto a full screen quad, which is rendered to the backbuffer
