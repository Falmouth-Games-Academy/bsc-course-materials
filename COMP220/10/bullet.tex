\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}{Bullet}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Bullet is an open-source Physics engine for simulation of rigid bodies (and more)
		\pause\item Created by Erwin Coumans, who previously worked on the \href{https://www.havok.com/havok-physics/}{\color{cyan}{Havok}} engine
		\pause\item \textbf{API} allows setting up a world and adding objects (and constraints) to it
		\pause\item Doesn't automatically update rendered objects - need to \textbf{manually send data} back and forth.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Plan}
	We are going to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item See where to \href{http://bulletphysics.org/}{\color{cyan}{download}} the Bullet source code from and \href{https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/README.md}{\color{cyan}{how to compile}} it
		\pause\item Integrate Bullet with our OpenGL application
		\pause\item Look at some of the features of the physics engine, including the debug drawing functionality and how it can be used
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
