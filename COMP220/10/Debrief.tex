\begin{frame}{Post Processing Stack}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item In theory we can chain post-processing effects together
		\pause\item Essentially we keep rendering to a texturing using different fragment shaders each time
		\pause\item These could be stored in a data structure such as a stack
		\pause\item Once we have completed the last effect on the stack, we then switch to normal rendering and display the result
	\end{itemize}
