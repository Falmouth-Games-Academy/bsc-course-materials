\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you are required to design and prototype a novel game controller device.
Your prototype should function as an input device, either for the game you developed in COMP130 last semester,
or for the game you are developing in COMP150 this semester.
Your prototype should use a hardware platform such as \emph{MaKey~MaKey}, \emph{Arduino}, \emph{Raspberry~Pi} etc,
to convert user actions into game inputs.

Computing for Games combines technical and creative skills in equal parts.
All of your assignments involve a mixture of the two;
in this assignment the emphasis is more on creativity.
You will build upon the technical skills you have learned so far,
combined with your own creativity and innovation,
to produce a unique creative artefact.

This assignment is formed of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
    \item \textbf{Design} a novel game controller device.
    \item \textbf{Build} a prototype of your game controller.
        Prepare \textbf{at least five} weekly reports (one per sprint),
        including images and short videos as appropriate, that document your iterative design and prototyping process.
    \item \textbf{Integrate} the controller into your game, and prepare a practical demonstration.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission Instructions}

\subsection*{Part A (Formative)}

On Trello, create a task board that defines the high concept and key requirements (in terms of components and user stories) of the controller. Arrange a meeting with your tutor to discuss your task board.

\subsection*{Part A (Summative)}

Take screenshots of your Trello task board, and include them in the summative submission
of your weekly reports (Part~B).

\subsection*{Part B (Formative)}

Fork the GitHub project at TODO, and write your weekly reports in the \texttt{readme.md} file.
Also use this repository for any other digital materials you create
(e.g.\ source code for firmware or software, illustration files, circuit diagrams etc.).

Images and code snippets should be embedded directly in the \texttt{readme.md} file.
Videos should be uploaded to a video sharing site (e.g.\ YouTube, Vimeo, Vine)
and linked from the \texttt{readme.md} file.

\subsection*{Part B (Summative)}

Compress the contents of your GitHub repository as a zip file,
and upload it to the appropriate submission queue on LearningSpace.
If you have used images and videos, ensure that they are included in the zip file.
Videos should be compressed in \texttt{avi} or \texttt{mp4} format.

\textbf{Materials that are not included in the zip file will not be considered for marking.}
In particular, please remember to add any videos to your zip file before submission,
as otherwise they will not be marked.

If you include video material, its \textbf{total combined length} must not exceed \textbf{three minutes}.
Exceeding this limit will be subject to the same penalties as detailed in the course's word count policy,
available on LearningSpace.
There is \textbf{no limit} on words or static images for this assignment.

\subsection*{Part C (Formative)}

No formal submission is required.
Attend the demo session (date and time to be confirmed in class)
with your prototype and an executable of your game,
and be prepared to discuss it with your tutors and peers.

\subsection*{Part C (Summative)}

Physical submission?

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Falmouth University is nationally and internationally renowned as an arts institution.
Despite the fact that you are studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in a technical discipline,
you are still expected to strive for the same level of \textbf{innovation and creative flair}
as your fellow students in other departments.
All assignments on this course involve a mix of technical and creative activities;
this assignment is more heavily weighted towards the creative than the assignments you have completed thus far.
On this assignment, a competent execution of an unimaginative idea is unlikely to achieve higher than a C grade overall,
as opposed to an imperfect execution of a unique and ambitious concept
--- bear this in mind when working on your design.

Your \textbf{design} should be motivated by user stories.
The history of video games is littered with failed peripherals which consumers simply did not want,
which were perceived as expensive gimmicks rather than legitimate enhancements to gameplay.
For higher marks you should demonstrate \textbf{commercial awareness}:
your user stories and design should be informed by your research into products that have succeeded and failed
in the past, and what unexplored niches exist in the present.

We have given you some of the materials you need: a MaKey~MaKey kit, crocodile clip leads and conductive paint.
You will need to add your own materials to produce a \textbf{functional} physical prototype.
A ``Blue Peter'' style prototype made from household items is fine,
as is something made out of modelling clay, construction toys etc.
However you should still choose your materials carefully, as overly flimsy construction may
lose you marks on the functionality criterion.

You may also wish to connect electronic components such as LEDs, buzzers, photoresistors etc to the MaKey~MaKey,
or even use a different, more flexible hardware platform such as Arduino.
However you are discouraged from spending large sums of money on extra hardware,
and doing so is \textbf{not required} to achieve a high mark.
If you choose to go down this route,
it is possible to purchase an Arduino and a selection of electronic components online for 
around the price of a textbook (\textsterling 20 -- \textsterling 30).\footnote{
    Note that the MaKey~MaKey kits provided in class are version~1.2, which, unlike earlier versions, is not based on Arduino.
    Any tutorials you may find online for reprogramming the MaKey~MaKey firmware using the Arduino IDE
    are unfortunately not applicable to this version.
}

You should aim to demonstrate a high level of \textbf{sophistication}
in the technical execution of your prototype.
An important part of sophistication is having the insight to choose the right tool for the job:
if a simpler technique fulfils all the requirements, use it.
The use of unnecessarily complicated techniques, serving only to showcase one's own cleverness,
is a dangerous habit for a software developer.

Your \textbf{weekly reports} should document the iterations you make on your design and prototyping.
The emphasis in this assignment is on creativity and rapid iteration,
so do not be afraid to ``go back to the drawing board'' if a prototyped idea does not work as well as anticipated.
However it is important to document (and learn from) your failures, even more so than your successes.

You are strongly encouraged to make use of sketches, diagrams, photographs, screenshots
and short videos to document your design and prototyping process.
Many indie game developers use such work-in-progress material as an important tool for promotion
and community engagement; for example, search Twitter for the hashtag \texttt{\#screenshotsaturday}.
Videos should ideally be short (5--30 second) demonstrations of functions of your prototype;
you may narrate if you wish, but it is not required.
