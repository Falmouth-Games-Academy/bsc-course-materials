\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you are required to critically reflect on your progress across the Semester and, in particular, review the strengths and weaknesses of the key skills that are influencing the quality of your work. You will also develop plans of action to overcome your weaknesses and thereby improve the quality of your work in future assignments.

Such reflection and planning is an extremely important part of learning games development, and in particular computer programming. They are key components in a technique known as deliberate practice, which research has shown to be very successful at nurturing expertise in software engineering. Everyone that properly adopts this technique eventually succeeds, despite the challenging nature of the subject. It is, therefore, very important that reflection and planning are not dismissed as an afterthought at the end of the course. For this reason, this assessment has two components, A and B, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item A series of brief weekly reports that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} your progress;
    		\item \textbf{assess} any problems or issues that you have encountered;
    		\item and then \textbf{outline} some specific actions to take to overcome these problems.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item A final 500-word report that must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{identify three} key skills that you consider weaknesses;
    		\item \textbf{assess} your application of \textbf{each} of these skills, \textit{describing how} they affected the quality of your submissions \textbf{and suggesting why} they became challenges;
    		\item and then \textbf{identify how} to improve \textbf{each} of these skills, with reference to SMART actions.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Part A consists of \textbf{multiple formative submissions} with deadlines at the end of each week across the Semester. This work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The threshold is set at 15\%. This means that 15\% of the total marks available for the coursework overall are awarded on a pass or fail basis. In other words, satisfactory submissions will be awarded 15\%. However, unsatisfactory submissions will receive 0\%.

The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail for each submission in Part A:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Progress has been described with adequate detail;
	\item Problems and issues have been clearly explained and assessed;
	\item There is evidence of reflection;
	\item At least one SMART action, appropriate for resolving the issue, has been outlined;
\end{enumerate}

You will receive ongoing feedback through your fortnightly tutorials and will have the opportunity to revise the work prior to the final deadline based on this feedback. It is especially important that work that is not yet satisfactory is revised based on the feedback provided as \textbf{all reports must be satisfactory to pass}.

Part B is a single summative submission and will be assessed on a criterion-referenced basis. This submission is expected to take students from the threshold of 15\% (F) up to the maximum of 100\% (A*). This means that 85\% of the total marks available for the coursework overall will be awarded.

The following criteria are used to allocate marks:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Appropriateness and Specificity of Selection of Key Skills;
	\item Adequacy of Self-Appraisal in Relation to Key Skills;
	\item Depth of Reflection on Key Skills;
	\item Appropriateness of Plan for the Future;
	\item Quality of Academic Writing;
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Submission Instructions}

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A must be completed as a formative submission on GitHub. Fork the GitHub project at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp110-evaluation}

Write your weekly reports in the \texttt{readme.md} file. Also use this repository for any other digital assets you create (e.g.\ images), checking them in regularly as you work on your projects. For the reports, images should be embedded directly in the \texttt{readme.md} file. Videos should be uploaded to a video sharing site (e.g.\ YouTube, Vimeo, Vine) and linked from the \texttt{readme.md} file.

You will need to show your most recent weekly reports to your tutor during each of your fortnightly tutorials, at which point they will be signed-off.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B must be completed as a single PDF document, prepared in LaTeX. The LaTeX source files should be hosted on GitHub in the same repository as Part A. The single PDF document must be submitted to the LearningSpace by the final submission deadline as shown on LearningSpace. Please note that the LearningSpace will only accept a single PDF document.

You will receive formal feedback three weeks after the submission deadline shown on LearningSpace.

Making good use of [reflection and deliberate practice] are an essential part of this process.''

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Reflection is taking time to examine thoughts, feelings, beliefs, values, attitudes and assumptions in the context of a specific topic, situation, problem, issue, or process. Part of reflection is relating these varied understandings to your experiences of or within the context. Then analysing that relation to work out how and why an understanding arose. Further to this is projecting that relationship into the future, drawing on the how and the why, to identify future activities. Thus, combining these leads to a plan on how to develop your knowledge and improve your skills.

A common mistake made by beginners to reflective writing is to use many words to describe the context and/or the experience. Avoid this. The description of an experience is not particularly important. It is the analysis and evaluation of that experience which is important because this will reveal interesting insights about yourself and your actions which will be useful when planning more effective actions in the future.

Computing knowledge and, in particular, programming skills require a significant investment in time and energy to develop. However, quality of practice is more important than quantity of practice. Your readiness, the suitability of the form of practice, and the relevance of the skill being practised are all important factors which affect quality. Given that you must work to tight deadlines, it is very important that time and energy is used effectively to optimise progress. A strategy that has shown success at achieving this optimisation is deliberate practice.

A continuous cycle of reflection and planning forms the cornerstone of deliberate practice. Unfortunately, however, another common mistake that students make is treating this reflection as an afterthought. This is a problem because rather than focusing on the development process, there is often too much attention on the end-product: the actual submitted work. However, it is important to consider that software development is a process. It is the experience of that process and how to change that process that is important. This is what will lead to higher quality submissions in the future and forms the underlying purpose of this assignment. Subsequently, failing to record experiences and failing to engage in regular reflection will not only slow your progress substantially but will also result in a poorly focused report.

So what is deliberate practice? Briefly, it is practice which is: conscious and intentional; designed with your current skill level in mind to force an exerted effort but avoid frustration; provides relevant and measurable feedback to track progress; and follows a repeatable structure.

A common mistake when planning such practice is being too general. It is, therefore, important to consider SMART actions: specific; measurable; achievable; relevant; and time-bound. Also note, problem solving and designing are particularly important programming skills and approaches to developing skills in these areas can be relevant.
