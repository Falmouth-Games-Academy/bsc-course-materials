- **Analyse** data in R
- **Visualise** data in R

## What is R?
![R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS](assets/LOGO.png)

## RStudio
![A very powerful tool for working in R (this entire slidedeck has been created in R and RMarkdown)](assets/rstudio.png)\


## Tidyverse
![An opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science](assets/tidyverse.png)

## Psych
![A general purpose toolbox for personality, psychometric theory and experimental psychology. Functions are primarily for multivariate analysis and scale construction using factor analysis, principal component analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others provide basic descriptive statistics.](assets/psych.png)

## Information Presentation 
- There are various techniques for reformatting and reducing data to make the analysis more interpretable or to illustrate a key point
-  Graphical representations will also assist in decision making and reinforce the justification for those decisions e.g., has a hypothesis been falsified? To what extent is it clearly falsified?
- An overall picture of the data can be gleaned and initial conclusions drawn
- It is important to select the most effective ways to illustrate your findings in the dissertation

## Information Presentation 
- Your communication skills are under assessment; keep all graphical depiction meaningful to justifying your analysis and/or your intellectual decisions
- Provides an overall picture of the data underlying your findings to reach and support your conclusions
- Be wary of delegating charts solely to important data:
    + Depictions can distort message of original data 
    + Concise, but often lacks precision
    + Ensure adequate support in body of text
    + Leverage explicit references (e.g., “as shown in Figure 1”)

## ggplot
![The anatompy of a ggplot command](assets/ggplot.png)

## Bar Chart in R
```
> ggplot(dat, aes(GENDER)) + geom_bar()
```

```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(GENDER)) + geom_bar()
```


## Complex Bar Chart
![ [ Docs: Bar and line graphs (ggplot2)](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/Bar_and_line_graphs_(ggplot2)) ](assets/complexbar.png)

## Histogram
- A type of vertical bar chart used to depict a frequency distribution
- Construction steps:
    + Label the **x** axis with the class endpoints
    + Label the **y** axis with the frequencies
    + Label the chart with an appropriate title, i.e. not 'bar chart'
- A quick look at the histogram reveals which class intervals produce the highest frequency totals E.g. which age group most often enrols in undergraduate computing courses?

## Histogram in R
```
> ggplot(dat, aes(BIRTH_YEAR)) + geom_histogram(
  breaks=seq(1970, 2000, by =5), 
  fill="red", 
  aes(alpha = ..count..)) + 
  labs(x = "Year of Birth", 
    y = "Count", 
    title = "Breakdown of Birth Years")
```

## Histogram Output
```{r}
ggplot(
  dat, aes(BIRTH_YEAR)) + geom_histogram(
  breaks=seq(1970, 2000, by =5), 
  fill="red", 
  aes(alpha = ..count..)
) + labs(
  x = "Year of Birth", 
  y = "Count", 
  title = "Breakdown of Birth Years")
```

## Frequency Polygon
- A graph in which line segments connecting the dots depict a frequency distribution
- Construction steps:
    + Label the **x** axis with the class endpoints
    + Label the **y** axis with the frequencies
    + Plot a dot for the frequency value at the midpoint of each class interval
    + Connect the dots with a line
    
## Frequency Polygon in R

```
> ggplot(dat, aes(CONSCIENTIOUSNESS), stat="count") 
  + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 20) 
  + labs(
    x = "Year of Birth", 
    y = "Count", 
    title = "Breakdown of Birth Years")
```
## Frequency Polygon Output

```{r}
ggplot(dat, aes(CONSCIENTIOUSNESS), stat="count") + geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 20) + labs(x = "Level of Conscientiousness", y = "Count", title = "Breakdown of Conscientiousness")
```

## OGive 
- A Cumulative Frequency (CF) polygon
- Construction steps:
    + Label the x axis with the class endpoints
    + Label the y axis with the cumulative frequencies
    + A dot of ‘0’ is placed at the beginning of the first class
    + Mark a dot for the CF value at the end of each class interval
    + Connect these dots with a line

## OGive in R
To construct an ogive, you need to format the data into cumulative frequencies:
```
cf <- c(0, cumsum(
  table(
    cut(dat$CONSCIENTIOUSNESS, seq(0, 240, by=20), 
    right=FALSE))))
```
Then plot the chart based on this data:
```
plot(seq(0, 240, by=20), 
  cf, 
  main="Range of Conscientiousness", 
  xlab="Level of Conscientiousness", 
  ylab="Cumulative Frequency") 
    + lines(seq(0, 240, by=20), cf)

```

## OGive Output
\tiny
```{r message=FALSE}
par(bg = "white")
cf <- c(0, cumsum(table(cut(dat$CONSCIENTIOUSNESS, seq(0, 240, by=20), right=FALSE))))
plot(seq(0, 240, by=20), cf, main="Range of Conscientiousness", xlab="Level of Conscientiousness",
ylab="Cumulative Frequency") + lines(seq(0, 240, by=20), cf)

```

## Pie Chart
- A circular depiction of data where the area of the whole pie = 100% of the data being studied.
- Slices represent a % breakdown of each of the values 
- Business uses: e.g. for depicting budget categories, market share, time and resource allocation
- Generally more difficult to interpret the size of the slices compared to the bars in a histogram. But- usage of ‘%’ can clarify slice size

## Construction steps
1. Convert each toothpaste brand amount to a proportion by dividing each individual amount by the total
$$ 102 / 200 = 0.51 $$

2. Convert each proportion to degrees by multiplying by 360°
$$ 0.51 * 360 = 183.6 $$

## Pie Chart in R
```
Lbls <- c(
  "Prior Experience with Pre-University Qualification", 
  "Prior Experience without Pre-University Qualification", 
  "No Prior Experience")

pieValues <- as.data.frame(table(dat$PRIOR_EXP))

pieValues$labels = Lbls

pie(
  pieValues$Freq, 
  labels = pieValues$labels, 
  main="Pie Chart of Countries")
```

## Pie Chart Output
```{r}
par(bg = "white")
Lbls <- c("Prior Experience with Pre-University Qualification", "Prior Experience without Pre-University Qualification", "No Prior Experience")

# count the number of times a value x appears in the vector
pieValues <- as.data.frame(table(dat$PRIOR_EXP))

# add the labels as new column to dataframe
pieValues$labels = Lbls


pie(pieValues$Freq, labels = pieValues$labels, main="Pie Chart of Countries")
```

## Scatter Plot
- Illustrates the relationship between two variables based on its underlying data points
- E.g. the link between neurotic personality traits and programming anxiety
- Scatter graph - a two-dimensional graph plot of pairs of points from two variables
- Relationships will vary in strength, line of best fit used to indicate magnitude through slope

## Scatter Plot in R
```
ggplot(dat, aes(x=ANXIETY, y=NEUROTICISM)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +   
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   
                se=FALSE)    
```

## Scatter Plot Output
```{r message=FALSE}
ggplot(dat, aes(x=ANXIETY, y=NEUROTICISM)) +
    geom_point(shape=1) +    # Use hollow circles
    geom_smooth(method=lm,   # Add linear regression line
                se=FALSE)    # Don't add shaded confidence region
```


## Box Plot in R
```
dat$P_EXP <- factor(
  dat$PRIOR_EXP, 
  labels = c(
    "Prior (qualified)", 
    "Prior (unqualified)", 
    "No Prior"))

ggplot(dat, aes(x = P_EXP, y = ANXIETY)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(
    x = "Level of experience", 
    y = "Anxiety", 
    title = "Anxiety of Students")
```

## Box Plots Output
```{R message=FALSE}
# add the labels as a new column
dat$P_EXP <- factor(dat$PRIOR_EXP, labels = c("Prior (qualified)", "Prior (unqualified)", "No Prior"))

ggplot(dat, aes(x = P_EXP, y = ANXIETY)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Level of experience", y = "Anxiety", title = "Anxiety of Students from Different Backgrounds")
```
