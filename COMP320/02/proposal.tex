\begin{frame}{Research proposal}
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause\item Last week you were asked to prepare a $\approx$ 500-word research proposal
        \pause\item Divide into pairs --- pair up with someone who \textbf{doesn't know} (much) about your proposed project
        \pause\item 5 minutes: \textbf{read} each other's proposals
        \pause\item I will ask \textbf{you} to explain:
            \begin{itemize}
                \pause\item In 1 sentence: what is \textbf{their} proposed research topic/question?
                \pause\item In 1 sentence: why is this interesting and/or important?
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research proposal}
    Discuss in your pairs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause\item Did you understand each other's proposals?
        \pause\item Were there any misunderstandings or misrepresentations?
        \pause\item How can the proposal, and particularly the research question, be improved?
    \end{itemize}
    For the rest of this session:
    \begin{itemize}
        \pause\item Refine your proposal, ready for your supervision meeting
    \end{itemize}
