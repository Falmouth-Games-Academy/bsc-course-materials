			culminating in your research question(s)
		\pause\item \textbf{Literature review}: survey existing work related to your project
		\pause\item \textbf{Method}: explain how you went about answering your research question
		\pause\item \textbf{Results}: present and analyse the data obtained, and discuss how it addresses
			your research question
		\pause\item \textbf{Conclusion}: summarise the dissertation, suggest directions for further work
		\pause\item \textbf{References}
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{The purpose of the literature review}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Understand the \textbf{context} of your work
		\pause\item Understand the \textbf{state of the art} in the field
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item What is currently known?
				\pause\item What are the important open questions?
				\pause\item What research methods are used in the field?
			\end{itemize}
		\pause\item Understand how \textbf{your work} fits in
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item Is your work \textbf{novel} (i.e.\ has it not been done before?)
