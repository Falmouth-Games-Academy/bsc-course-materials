\part{Final year project}
\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}{BCS guidelines}
	It is expected that within an undergraduate programme, students will undertake a \textbf{major computing project}, normally in
	their final year and normally as an individual activity, giving them the opportunity to demonstrate:

	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item their ability to apply \textbf{practical and analytical skills} present in the programme as a whole
		\pause\item \textbf{innovation} and/or \textbf{creativity}
		\pause\item \textbf{synthesis} of information, ideas and practices to provide a \textbf{quality solution} together with an \textbf{evaluation} of that solution
		\pause\item that their project meets a \textbf{real need} in a wider context
		\pause\item the ability to \textbf{self-manage} a significant piece of work
		\pause\item \textbf{critical self-evaluation} of the process
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Final year project assignments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item The final year project is made up of \textbf{four} separate assignments
		\pause\item In COMP320 (this study block):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Prototype research artefact
			\item Research review and proposal
		\end{itemize}
		\pause\item In COMP360 (next study block):
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Research artefact
			\item Dissertation
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Deliverables}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Week 2: Brief project proposal
		\pause\item Week 4: Research ethics Approval Form
		\pause\item Week 7: Presentation on Literature Review
		\pause\item Week 8: Research Review and Proposal --- Peer Review
		\pause\item Week 10: Submit Research Review and Proposal
		\pause\item Week 13 (after xmas): Submit Prototype Research Artefact
		\pause\item Week 13 (after xmas): Presentation on Proposal, Prototype, and Preliminary Results
		\pause\item Formative deadlines: check MyFalmouth
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Note on Presentations}
	The submission of the literature review and proposal in \textbf{Week 10} is worth \textbf{$70\%$} of the module. Or, $11.6\%$ of the overall degree classification. Please do not neglect it! 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	It will require considerable effort to read the literature, refine your question, and propose a sound research design!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Note on Presentations}
	Presentations will be delivered to `non-domain' experts. These are research-active staff who will be outside of your field. Present your materials as-if writing for a competent computing professional who is unfamiliar with your specific field.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research Review and Proposal}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Essentially the \textbf{first half} of your \textbf{dissertation}
		\pause\item Maximum \textbf{six pages}, in \textbf{IEEE Transactions} format
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item Same format as an academic journal paper
				\pause\item Page limit \textbf{excludes} figures, tables, references and appendices
				\pause\item 6 pages $\approx$ 6000 words
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Research review and proposal}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Give a thorough \textbf{literature review} of your chosen topic
		\pause\item Suggest and justify one or more \textbf{research questions}
		\pause\item Describe your proposed \textbf{methodology}
		\pause\item Present any \textbf{preliminary results} you obtain this study block
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Prototype research artefact}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Some kind of \textbf{software} artefact --- depends on your project
		\pause\item For example:
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item A game or app that you will use to gather data from human testers
				\pause\item A testbed for computational experimentation
				\pause\item A case study for a particular design approach
				\pause\item A tool to be evaluated
			\end{itemize}
		\pause\item Discuss with your supervisor to decide what is appropriate
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
