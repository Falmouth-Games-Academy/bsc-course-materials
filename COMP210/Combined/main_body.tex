	\frametitle{A Word of Warning}
	AR/VR are both emerging technologies and thus, they borrow language from other similar disciplines such as \textbf{photography}, game development, film studies and 3D design. This appropriation of lexicons can be confusing and there will be some overlap in relation to key terms and definitions.

\begin{frame}
	``As babies, each of us has an astonishing liquid infinity of imagination on the inside; that butts up against the stark reality of the physical world. That the baby's imagination cannot be realised is a fundamental indignity that we only learn to live with when we decide to call ourselves adults. With virtual reality you have a world with many of the qualities of the physical world, but it doesn't resist us. It release us from the taboo against infinite possibilities. That's the reason virtual reality electrifies people so much.''

	\frametitle{Immersion}
	Immersion is the objective degree to which a VR system and application projects stimuli onto the sensory receptors. We discuss immersion in terms of:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extensiveness - Range of sensory modalities targeted 
		\item Matching - Stimuli vs reality
		\item Surrounding - Extent of environment (panoramic) and tracking
		\item Vividness - The quality of simulation
		\item Intractability - The quality of the input and outputs
		\item Plot - How compelling the narrative is

	\frametitle{Immersion vs. Presence}
	
	`Presence is the psychological state of subjective perception in which even though part or all of an individual's current experience is generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, part or all of the individual's perception fails to accurately acknowledge the role of the technology in the experience.' \\~\\
	
	International Society for Presence Research, 2000
	\\~\\
	\href{http://ispr.info}{[ISPR Website]}	
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Perceptual Modalities}
	
	``A perceptual modality can be defined as the means through which information is extracted from the environment'' (James and Galbraith, 1985) \\~\\
	
	Immersion is created by surrounding the user of the VR system in images, sound or other stimuli that provide an engrossing total environment. \\~\\
	In order to achieve an illusion of immersion a reality system must consider the perceptual modalities: \textbf{Sight}, \textbf{hearing}, touch, proprioception, \textbf{balance/motion}, smell and taste. \\~\\

	\frametitle{Vergence-Accommodation Conflict}
	
	\textbf{Vergence} - How your eyes track an object coming towards you. \\~\\

	\textbf{Accommodation} - When you pupils adjust to the objects light field. \\~\\
	
	The two actions are hardwired to work in sync as they are both trying aid the same process of tracking an object. They can be decoupled but it is not a comfortable experience for the user.

	\frametitle{Motion to Photon Latency}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Motion} - refers to the users movements in the physical space.
		\item \textbf{Photons} - The photons emitted from the HMD that are absorbed by photoreceptors (cones \& rods) on the retina.
		\item \textbf{Latency} - delay between the two. 
	\end{itemize}
	
		Put simply, motion to photon latency is the time it takes for the users movements in physical space to be visualised on the head-mounted display(HMD).
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Side Effects}
	The \textless20ms motion-to-photon latency gold standard. \\~\\
	
	When the motion to photon latency is greater than 20ms or anytime there is inconsistent stimuli between the players physical body motions and the visuals displayed in the head-mounted display (HMD) then there is a good chance that motion sickness/simulator sickness will occur. \\~\\

	According to the Oculus Rift docs, other factors that can contribute to simulator sickness are:

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Acceleration - minimize the size and frequency of accelerations
		\item Degree of control - don't take control away from the user
		\item Duration of simulator use - allow and encourage users to take breaks
		\item Altitude - avoid filling the field of view with the ground
		\item Binocular disparity - some find viewing stereoscopic images uncomfortable
		\item Field-of-View - reducing the amount of visual field covered by the virtual environment may also reduce comfort
		\item ... (the list goes on)
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Latency - minimize it; lags/dropped frames are uncomfortable in VR
		\item Distortion correction - use Oculus VR?s distortion shaders
		\item Flicker - do not display flashing images or fine repeating textures
		\item Experience - experience with VR makes you resistant to simulator sickness (which makes developers inappropriate test subjects)
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Balance}
	There are three systems at work to aid in balance:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Vestibular System (motion, equilibrium, spatial orientation)
		\item Proprioception (position, motion, and equilibrium)
		\item Vision (sight)
	\end{itemize}

	\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	Visually induced motion sickness (VIMS) is a specific type of motion sickness caused by a conflict between vision and both the proprioception and vestibular systems.  \\~\\
	
	According to Forbes, when a player is cycling a bike in VR, they have a tendency to lean to accommodate for corning, and as a consequence they fall off. \\~\\
	
	When tradition big screens cause VIMS the viewer can just look away but in VR this is not possible.

	 	\item	\textbf{Representation} fidelity - Hyper-realistic to abstract and non-objective worlds. 
		\item	\textbf{Interaction} Fidelity - Degree to which a interaction in VR corresponds with the same interaction in the real world.
		\item \textbf{Experiential} Fidelity - The degree to which the user experience matches the intentions of the VR creator. Procedural worlds have a very low experiential fidelity.
