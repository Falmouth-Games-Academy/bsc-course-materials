## Active VS. Passive Haptics

> “heart rate increases when subjects reach the virtual precipice, suggesting that physiological measures might be an indicator of presence”

## Proprioception

perception or awareness of the position and movement of the body.

> “Haptics is any form of interaction involving touch. It can refer to: Haptic communication, the means by which people and other animals communicate via touching. Haptic perception, the process of recognizing objects through touch."

## State of Flux

- Inside Out tracking
- Embedded systems
- Higher fidelity
- Better pass through
- Eye tracking (Foveated rendering)
- Emotion capture – got to get those mirror neurons firing (Facebook VR)
- Full body tracking
- natural input mappings 
- Go anywhere, be anything


## Tools for Immersion

Immersion is the objective degree to which a VR system and application projects stimuli onto the sensory receptors. We discuss immersion in terms of:

- Extensiveness - Range of sensory modalities targeted
- Matching - Stimuli vs reality
- Surrounding - Extent of environment (panoramic) and tracking
- Vividness - The quality of simulation
- Intractability - The quality of the input and outputs
- Plot - How compelling the narrative is


## Feeling Present

> “Presence is the psychological state of subjective perception in which even though part or all of an individual’s current experience is generated by and/or filtered through human-made technology, part or all of the individual’s perception fails to accurately acknowledge the role of the technology in the experience.”

International Society for Presence Research, 2000 ISPR Website

## Hamlet on the Holodeck

> “Books are good at delivering essentially linear stories, she insists, while computers are good at telling stories of a different kind: procedural, participatory, encyclopedic, and spatial. And they’re particularly good at telling stories that reflect the digital age—stories about fractured realities, complex systems, and networked ways of being in the world.”

The New Yorker on Janet H. Murray’s Hamlet on the Holodeck

## Some tips

- Use environmental wayfinding aids (explicit and subtle)
- Draw from architectural design and urban planning
- Be strategic
- Include distinct landmarks (tall if possible)
- Provide breadcrumbs to mark progress
- Use visual cues to guide navigation
- Place signs at nodes
- Use channels to restrict navigation

## Be Kind

- Acceleration - minimize the size and frequency of accelerations
- Degree of control - don’t take control away from the user
- Duration of simulator use - allow and encourage users to take breaks
- Altitude - avoid filling the field of view with the ground
- Binocular disparity - some find viewing stereoscopic images uncomfortable
- Field-of-View - reducing the amount of visual field covered by the virtual environment may also reduce comfort

(the list goes on)
