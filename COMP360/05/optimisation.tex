\begin{frame}{Optimisation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item \textbf{Optimisation} is the process of making a program \textbf{more efficient}
			in terms of speed, memory usage etc. 
        \pause\item Optimisation can \textbf{increase} or \textbf{decrease} software quality,
            depending on what measure of ``quality'' is being used
    \end{itemize}

		Rule 1: Don't do it.
		
		Rule 2 (for experts only): Don't do it yet.''

		``Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about,
		the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency
		actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.
		We \textit{should} forget about small efficiencies, say about 97\% of the time:
		\textbf{premature optimization is the root of all evil}.
		Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3\%.''

\begin{frame}{Levels of Optimisation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item System Level: Utilisation, Balancing and Efficiency
		\pause \item Algorithmic Level: Focus on removing work
		\pause \item Micro-Level: Line by line optimising (data structures is a good example here)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Optimisation Pitfalls}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item Assumptions: Always measure!
		\pause \item Premature Optimisation: Don't optimise with data, or too early in the development process
		\pause \item Optimisation on Only One Machine: Test on the worst case system
        \pause \item Optimising Debug Builds
        \pause \item Trying to second-guess the compiler: in many cases, the compiler is better at micro-level optimisation than you are!
