## Register Attendance
![Attendance monitoring is in place. It is your responsability to ensure that you have signed yourself in.](assets/tapit.png)

## Learning Outcomes {.build}
After this session you will be able to:

- **Exlain** the difference between current, voltage, and resistance
- **Predict** the characteristics of basic circuits using simple formulas
- **Choose** components based on their purpose and characteristics

## What is current electricity? 

(the stuff that makes our gadgets tick)

`r centerImage("assets/electrons.png", .9)`
^source:https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity/allrmar^

- The flow of electrons through
- a closed circuit (wire, components, etc)
- Induced by an electric field (battery)

## Battery Example

`r centerImage("assets/battery.png", .5) `

## Basic characteristics 

- **Voltage (V)** - The relative level of electrical energy between any two points in a circuit. Voltage is measured in *volts*.
- **Current (I)** - The amount of electrical energy passing through any point in a circui. Current is measured in *amps*
- **Resistence (R)** - The amount that any component in the circuit resists the flow of current. Resistence is measured in *ohms*
