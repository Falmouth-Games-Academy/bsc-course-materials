## Register Attendance
![Attendance monitoring is in place. It is your responsability to ensure that you have signed yourself in.](assets/tapit.png)

## Learning Outcomes {.build}
After this session you will be able to:

- **Exlain** the difference between current, voltage, and resistance
- **Predict** the characteristics of basic circuits using simple formulas
- **Choose** components based on their purpose and characteristics

## What is current electricity? 

(the stuff that makes our gadgets tick)

`r centerImage("assets/electrons.png", .9)`
^source:https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity/allrmar^

- The flow of electrons through
- a closed circuit (wire, components, etc)
- Induced by an electric field (battery)

## Battery Example

`r centerImage("assets/battery.png", .5) `
^source:https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity/allrmar^

## Basic characteristics 

- **Voltage (V)** - The relative level of electrical energy between any two points in a circuit. Voltage is measured in *volts*.
- **Current (I)** - The amount of electrical energy passing through any point in a circui. Current is measured in *amps*
- **Resistence (R)** - The amount that any component in the circuit resists the flow of current. Resistence is measured in *ohms*

## Water Analogy

## Resistors (Series vs. Parrallel)



## Ohm's Law

`r centerText("$I = V / R$", 40)` 

- If the voltage increases, whe the current (a) increase or (b) decrease.
- If the resistance increases will the current (a) increase or (b) decrease.

## Ohm's Law Example 1



## Ohm's Law Example 2


## Power (Watts-W)

Similar to current, Power is a measure of change over time. Instead of charge, power is the amount of energy converted into heat over time.

- When the flow of current is resisted, heat is generated
- Calculated by measuring the voltage across a load times the current flowing through it

`r centerText("$P = I x v$", 40)`

`r centerText("$P = V^2 / R$", 40)`

## The Rules

- Positive volatages are uppermost
- Things happen left to right
- All components have a name and values
- Remember symbols
- Dots show that the wires are connected: 
`r centerImage("assets/connections.png", .2)`
- Nets: Inferred connection based on symbol or name: 
`r centerImage("assets/connections.png", .2)`

## Voltage Divider

- Used to step down the voltage
- Involves a pair of resistors 

`r centerImage("assets/divider.png")`

## Voltage Divider Formula

`r centerImage("assets/divider-answer.png")`

`r centerText("$ V out = \\frac{V_s x R_2}{(R_1 / R_2)}$", 40)`
