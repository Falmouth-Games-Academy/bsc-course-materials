\begin{frame}{Intro}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item This is a principle from Computer Science that a class should have a single responsibility
		\pause \item Take for example a Player class which handles input, physics, weapons, health and inventory
		\pause \item This should probably be split into several classes (Remember Class naming from previous slide)
	\end{itemize}
