\begin{frame}{Description}
    On this module, you learn how to apply artificial intelligence in the context of games. You will gain in understanding and experience of the technical dimension of artificial intelligence and you could leverage it in the particular expressive context within game development. You will apply your learning in a practical context where you will design artificially intelligent agents for a game in a live brief format, taking as your cue the gameâ€™s concept.
