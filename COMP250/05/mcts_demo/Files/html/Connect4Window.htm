	    <h1>How to play</h1>
        <p>
        This is the classic game of <b>Connect 4</b>.
        Players take turns to drop a counter into the top of the board, which then falls down into the lowest available space.
        To win, you must make a line of four counters in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line.
        </p><p>
        To drop your counter, simply tap the screen!
        </p>

        <h1>How the computer plays</h1>
        <p>
        The computer player uses a method called <b>Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)</b>.
        MCTS works by building a <b>tree</b> of game moves, one branch at a time.
        In Computer Science, a <b>tree</b> is a way of organising data in a branching structure &mdash; like a family tree, for example.
        MCTS uses a <b>game tree</b>:
        each point in the tree is a position in the game,
        and each branch is a move that can be played from that position.
        </p><p>
        MCTS <b>simulates</b> thousands of complete games.
        The outcomes of these simulations (win, loss or draw) are recorded in the tree.
        Further simulations use this information to concentrate on the lines of play that most often lead to a win.
        In this way, MCTS <b>learns</b> the best line of play &mdash; and hence the best move to make next.
        </p><p>
        The display above shows the tree MCTS is building as it decides which move to play next.
        The <b>colour</b> of a branch shows how likely that branch is to lead to a
        <b><span style="color:Green">win</span></b>, <b><span style="color:Orange">draw</span></b> or <b><span style="color: Red">loss</span></b> for the MCTS player.
        The <b>thickness</b> of a branch shows how many simulated games have included that move, i.e. how much time MCTS has spent considering that line of play.
