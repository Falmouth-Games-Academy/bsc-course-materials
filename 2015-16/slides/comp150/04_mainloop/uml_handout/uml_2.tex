\title{UML Worksheet II}
\author{COMP150: Game Development Practice}
\date{}

\maketitle

Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a way of communicating the design of software using diagrams. It is a notation that built upon the work of Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and the Rational Software Corporation. It was originally developed to support the object-oriented paradigm, although has since been extended to accommodate a diverse range of projects. According to the Object Management Group (OMG), UML is the international standard for software modelling.

\section{In-Class Task}

In today's in-class task you will learn how to draw \textbf{UML Activity} and \textbf{UML State} diagrams. To complete this you will:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Organise} yourselves into your COMP150 project teams.
	\item \textbf{Watch} the video tutorial at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFTAIj2N2Lc}.
	\item \textbf{Read} \url{http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/activityDiagram.htm}.
	\item \textbf{Draw} a UML Activity diagram to model ONE part (e.g. game flow) of your game.
	\item \textbf{Watch} the video tutorial at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6TFVzBW7oo}.
	\item \textbf{Read} \url{http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/stateMachineDiagram.htm}.
	\item \textbf{Draw} a UML State diagram to model ONE part (e.g.an AI agent) of your game.
\end{itemize}
