\begin{frame}{In this section}
    In this section you will learn how to:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Discuss} the importance of software testing in game development
        \item \textbf{Identify} the different types and levels of testing
        \item \textbf{Apply} test-driven development practices to your own programming projects
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Quality}
    Last time: \pause
    \begin{itemize}
        \item There are many ways of measuring the \textbf{quality} of a game or piece of software \pause
        \item \textbf{Quality assurance} is important to ensure that the software is of sufficiently high
            quality to provide benefit to developers and end users
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Finding \textbf{inadvertent errors} in the design and implementation of software \pause
        \item Often takes more time and effort than any other part of development \pause
        \item ... but letting errors slip into the final product can be even more costly \pause
        \item Testing $\neq$ quality assurance \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Testing is an important part of QA, but \textbf{not the only part}
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Who is responsible?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Last time, we discussed that \textbf{designers}, \textbf{developers},
            \textbf{publishers}, and maybe even \textbf{players}
            share the responsibility for software quality in games \pause
        \item Who should take responsibility for \textbf{testing}? \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item ``\textbf{Developers} write the code, so they should make sure it works''? \pause
                \item ``\textbf{Everyone} is responsible for quality, so everyone should pitch in''? \pause
                \item ``Code should be tested by \textbf{someone other} than the developer who wrote it''?
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Socrative \texttt{6E8NSW3IN}}
    So who should test game software?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In pairs.
		\item Discuss for 2-minutes.
		\item \textbf{Suggest} which parties should take responsibility for testing \textbf{and justify} your answer.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Testing strategy}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Development starts with system engineering and works \textbf{inwards} \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The \textbf{waterfall model} \pause
                \item Agile doesn't quite work like this \pause
            \end{itemize}
        \item Testing starts with unit testing and works \textbf{outwards} \pause
        \item \textbf{White box testing}: testing the software \textbf{with} knowledge of its internal workings \pause
        \item \textbf{Black box testing}: testing the software \textbf{without} knowledge of its internal workings
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unit testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{unit test} is a piece of code that verifies a \textbf{unit} (e.g.\ a function or class) of a program \pause
        \item E.g.\ verifies that a function called with a particular set of parameters returns the expected result \pause
        \item E.g.\ verifies that a function called with invalid parameters throws the expected error
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Designing user tests}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Test the \textbf{edge cases} \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Programming errors often occur at the \textbf{boundary} between valid and invalid input,
                    or the boundary between one case and another \pause
                \item E.g.\ for an $n$-element data structure, test accessing elements $n-1$, $n$, $n+1$ \pause
            \end{itemize}
        \item Aim for high \textbf{coverage} \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Ideally, \textbf{every line of code} should be executed in \textbf{at least one} unit test
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

            \end{center}
        \end{column}
        \begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Unit testing generally requires extra code to be written \pause
                \item \textbf{Driver} --- to set up any required state and run the test \pause
                \item \textbf{Stubs} --- to replace any modules upon which the module under test depends
            \end{itemize}
        \end{column}
    \end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Integration testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Verify that the individual units work \textbf{together} \pause
        \item Can be done \textbf{top-down} or \textbf{bottom-up} \pause
        \item Either way, the idea is to gradually replace stubs and drivers with actual units,
            testing as you go \pause
        \item \textbf{Regression testing} is important --- re-running tests to ensure that recent additions
            have not broken anything
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Socrative \texttt{6E8NSW3IN}}
	If the units have been thoroughly tested individually, why is integration testing needed?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In pairs.
		\item Discuss for 2-minutes.
		\item Give an \textbf{example} of a problem that integration testing might uncover,
            but that unit testing might miss. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Validation testing}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Testing the complete software system from the user's point of view \pause
        \item E.g.\ playtesting
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Socrative \texttt{6E8NSW3IN}}
	If unit testing and integration testing have been done correctly, why is validation testing needed?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In pairs.
		\item Discuss for 2-minutes.
		\item Give an \textbf{example} of a problem that validation testing might uncover,
            but that unit and integration testing might miss. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{When is testing ``done''?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The aim of testing is to find bugs, so it's done when there are no bugs left to be found! \smiley{} \pause
        \item When the software is (quantitatively or qualitatively) ``good enough'' \pause
        \item Testing is never ``done'' --- the burden just shifts onto the users
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Test driven development (TDD)}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A development process that advocates writing the unit tests \textbf{first} \pause
        \item Repeat the following three steps: \pause
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item \textbf{Red}: create a new test case, which should initially \textbf{fail} \pause
                \item \textbf{Green}: write code to make the new test \textbf{succeed} (without causing the other test cases to fail) \pause
                \item \textbf{Refactor}: \textbf{improve} the code, ensuring that all tests still \textbf{succeed}
            \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why TDD?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Often easier to convert a \textbf{user story} into test cases rather than directly into code \pause
        \item Writing the bare minimum of code to make the test ``green''
            lets you \textbf{focus on user stories}, not on \textbf{over-generalisation} or \textbf{non-essential functionality} \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{KISS}: Keep It Simple, Stupid
                \item \textbf{YAGNI}: You Aren't Gonna Need It
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Red}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Create a new test case, which should initially \textbf{fail} \pause
        \item Write only enough code to allow the test case to compile and run,
            e.g.\ write a \textbf{stub} function \pause
        \item What if the test succeeds? \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Maybe you already implemented that feature? \pause
                \item Maybe the test case is wrong? \pause
                \item Maybe your unit testing code is broken?
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Green}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add the \textbf{bare minimum} of code to make the new test case succeed \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{K}eep \textbf{I}t \textbf{S}imple, \textbf{S}tupid! \pause
            \end{itemize}
        \item Verify that \textbf{all} unit tests now succeed \pause
        \item What if old tests now fail? \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Fix it \pause
                \item \textbf{Or} revert and start again --- can be faster than debugging \pause
                \item (you \textbf{did} commit before you started, right?)
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Refactor}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item E.g. remove duplication, improve names, add documentation, apply design patterns, ... \pause
        \item To generalise or not to generalise? \pause
        \item \textbf{Do} generalise if it makes the code \textbf{simpler} \pause
        \item \textbf{Don't} generalise because you ``might'' need it later \pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Y}ou \textbf{A}ren't \textbf{G}onna \textbf{N}eed \textbf{I}t!
                \item Wait until it \textbf{is} needed in another cycle \pause
            \end{itemize}
        \item Verify that \textbf{all} unit tests still succeed
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Socrative \texttt{6E8NSW3IN}}
	How suitable is the test driven approach for game development?
	\begin{itemize}
		\item In pairs.
		\item Discuss for 2-minutes.
		\item Suggest \textbf{one advantage and one disadvantage} of test driven development
            in the context of game development
