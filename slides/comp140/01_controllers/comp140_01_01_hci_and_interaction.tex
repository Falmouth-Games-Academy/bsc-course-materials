    \textbf{Why} is HCI relevant to games?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	It is...
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An academic discipline: studying people interacting with technology
		\item A design discipline: designing interventions for systems involving people and technology
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	It is important to distinguish between \textbf{the subject of human-computer interaction} and the notion of
	\textbf{a human computer interface}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Human-computer action is ``the disciplines concerned with the design, evaluation, 
		and implementation of interactive computer systems for human use and the study of major phenomena
		surrounding them'' (Dix, 1998, xi). It involves understanding, analysing, and implementing computer
		systems for human use.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	It is important to distinguish between \textbf{the subject of human-computer interaction} and the notion of
	\textbf{a human computer interface}:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The human-computer interface involves those aspects of a system that users interact with. That is,
		the \textit{zone of interaction}. It is the part of the computer system that provided access to a computers
		internal resources. This is a technology, rather than a discipline.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	In the early era of computing, the `ease of use' of interfaces was given little attention:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Restricted access
		\item Specialist users
		\item Very specific use-cases for computers
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	Now that technology has matured enough for games to evolve into a mass-market phenomena, it is now a goal for
	computer systems to be made more accessible to a wider range of users for a greater variety of interaction styles. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is only possible by designing for the needs of such players
		\item Expecting players to adapt is inappropriate, they simply won't buy your games
		\item Incompetence-inducing controls are linked to aggression (Przybylski \textit{et al}, 2014)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	For interactive systems such as games this has come to mean designing the user interface. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The part of the system which the user is in immediate contact
		\item This includes input and output devices.
		\item Estimates suggest anything up to 80\% of the code supports the interface (Perry, 2006)
		\item A great deal of development time and effort is required working with people to achieve high usability --- 
		very different to the `being a basement code monkey' myth
	\end{itemize}

	Interactive systems include more than just gadgets.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Wristwatches
		\item Mobile phones
		\item Smart Televisions
		\item Microwave ovens

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	Interaction is the key to understanding the role of HCI in designing appropriate user interfaces (and, thereby, successful games). 
	Such interaction assumes two forms of communication:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Player to Game (i.e., pressing buttons, pointing the mouse, typing, etc.)
		\item Game to Player (i.e., displaying information, tactile feedback, etc.)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \textbf{List} examples of player-to-game communication.

    \textbf{List} examples of game-to-player communication.

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This two-way interaction is critical to the design and play of games.
		\item  It is what makes their design particularly challenging and interesting for computing professionals. 
		\item ...
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{HCI and Interactive Systems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As players of games, we have become engaged more and more with this two way process of providing
		the system with input, interpreting the output of the game, and responding accordingly with new input.
		\item This forms the \textbf{interaction cycle}.
		\item However, we need to take a step-back, as professionals, to be able to analyse the accordances of such a cycle.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{So, What Is Human-Computer Interaction?}
	Human-computer interaction is the name of the approach we use to study and improve interactive systems. It is concerned with:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The joint performance of tasks by humans and machines. 
		\item The structure of human-machine communication.
		\item Social and organisational interaction with machines.
		\item Human capabilities in machine use.
		\item ...
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{So, What Is Human-Computer Interaction?}
	Human-computer interaction is the name of the approach we use to study and improve interactive systems. It is concerned with:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ...
		\item Interface mechanisms.
		\item Interface specification and implementation
		\item Design trade-offs.
		\item and many other concerns (see Dix, 1998 for further notes).
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{So, What Is Human-Computer Interaction?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It lies at the intersection between the social and cognitive sciences, on the one hand.
		\item and Computer Science and technology, on the other.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{So, What Is Human-Computer Interaction?}
	The three main roles of HCI are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Analysing and designing specific interaction technologies (e.g. displays, pointing devices, user agents, etc.)
		\item Studying and improving the processes of technology development (e.g. usability quality assurance, design methods, evaluation techniques, etc.)
		\item Developing and evaluating new applications (e.g. multimedia, mulsemedia, other immersives, etc.)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{So, What Is Human-Computer Interaction?}
	HCI integrates:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Scientific research concerns... \pause
		\item ...with the engineering goal of improving usability of computers. \pause
		\item That is, improving the `fit' of games to their players --- and it is obviously easier to change the design of a game than it is to change its player.
	\end{itemize}
