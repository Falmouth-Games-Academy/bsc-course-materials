\begin{frame}{So far (hopefully)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item You have gotten to know your \textbf{team} and \textbf{product owner}
		\pause\item You have settled on your \textbf{concept}
		\pause\item You have planned your \textbf{individual contributions}
		\pause\item You have begun \textbf{production}, approaching completion of your \textbf{first sprint}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Important dates}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Check MyTimetable and MyFalmouth for exact dates
		\pause\item Middle of March: \textbf{Show and Tell Day}
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item Your team will deliver a \textbf{trade show style presentation} to \textbf{Games Academy staff and students}
			\end{itemize}
		\pause\item Before Easter break: \textbf{deadline}
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item I.e.\ your game needs to be finished!!!
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Unprofessional practice}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item \textbf{Lock yourself away} and work on your own thing
		\pause\item \textbf{Never} check that what you're working on fits with the project as a whole
		\pause\item Or even better, let \textbf{everyone else} do the work!
		\pause\item \textbf{Skip} daily stand-ups and other meetings
		\pause\item \textbf{Blame others} for not pulling their weight
		\pause\item If you don't like your game concept, use this as an \textbf{excuse} to not do any work
		\pause\item If you don't feel like you can \textbf{contribute}, don't bother trying
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Professional practice}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Communicate, communicate, communicate!
		\pause\item Communicate with your \textbf{team}
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item In person \textbf{and} online
			\end{itemize}
		\pause\item Turn up to \textbf{daily stand-ups} and \textbf{other meetings}
		\pause\item Communicate with your \textbf{Product Owner}
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item In person \textbf{and} online
			\end{itemize}
		\pause\item Use the \textbf{tools}
			\begin{itemize}
				\pause\item Slack, Trello, Discourse, Git, SVN, ...
				\pause\item Include your Product Owner in your digital communications
			\end{itemize}
		\pause\item If there are issues affecting your work, \textbf{communicate!}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why do we do this?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Technical skills will only get you so far in the industry
		\pause\item The \#1 skill employers look for is \textbf{ability to work in a team}
		\pause\item I.e.\ a so-so programmer with good team skills is \textbf{much more employable} than a C++ wizard who won't play nice with others
		\pause\item \textbf{This project} (and similar projects in years 2 and 3) are your chance to demonstrate this skill
		\pause\item Also you're building a \textbf{portfolio} --- again, someone who has built something decent
			is more employable than someone who has good qualifications on paper but no portfolio to back them up
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
