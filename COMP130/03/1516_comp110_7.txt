¥ RelationshipsÐ OOP models three types of real-world relationships: isa, hasa and isatypeof¥ Donald is a duck¥ A duck has a bill¥ A duck is a type of bird¥ Is-a --> InstantiationÐ ÒX is a YÓ means Òthe specific object X is an object of the type YÓÐ Is-a is modelled by classes and instances:¥ ÒDonald is a duckÓ --> ÒDonald is an instance of the class DuckÓ¥ Has-a --> CompositionÐ ÒX has a YÓ means Òan object of type X possesses an object of type YÓÐ OOP models this by having a field on X which holds a reference to an instance of Y¥ ÒA duck has a billÓ --> ÒThe class Duck has a field which points to an instance of the class BillÓ¥ Is-a-type-of --> InheritanceÐ ÒX is a type of YÓ means ÒIf an object is of type X, then it is also of type YÓ¥ ÒA duck is a type of birdÓ --> ÒIf something is a duck, then it is also a birdÓ¥ ÒEvery duck is a birdÓ¥ ÒIf something is true for all birds, then it must be true for ducksÓÐ In OOP terms, this is called inheritance¥ InheritanceÐ Recall: an object is a collection of fields (data) and methods (code)Ð Recall: the class defines which fields and methods an object possessesÐ ÒX is a type of YÓ --> class X inherits from class YÐ Class X inherits all of the fields and methods from class Y, as well as any fields and methods of its own¥ When to inherit?Ð When modelling an is-a-type-of relationship from the real worldÐ When several classes can share some fields and/or methods¥ I.e. to minimise code duplicationÐ When several classes should have methods with the same names, but which do different things¥ This is called polymorphism Ð more on this later¥ Inheritance in Python¥ Inheritance in Python¥ Inheritance in Python¥ Inheritance in Python¥ Inheritance in Python¥ Chains of inheritanceÐ ÒA mallard is a type of duck, which is a type of bird, which is a type of vertebrate, which is a type of animalÉÓÐ Is-a-type-of is transitive¥ If A is-a-type-of B and B is-a-type-of C, then A is-a-type-of CÐ Likewise: class A inherits from class B, which inherits from class C, É¥ ÒInherits fromÓ is also transitive¥ A possible inheritance hierarchy¥ OOP: Polymorphism¥ PolymorphismÐ From Greek: Òmany-shape-ismÓÐ Different classes can have the same public interfaceÐ Thus we can write code that uses this interface, but doesnÕt need to worry about the implementation behind it¥ Method overridingÐ A class can override methods defined in the class from which it inheritsÐ The overridden method can call the method from the base class, but it doesnÕt have to¥ Without polymorphismÐ We have a list of shapes, and want to draw them allÐ This approach is messy and difficult to maintain¥ Polymorphism to the rescue!Ð All subclasses of Shape implement drawÐ We can call shape.draw() without worrying which type of shape it is¥ Abstract classes and methodsÐ Some classes should never be instantiated directly, as they only exist to be inherited from¥ Shape is an exampleÐ Such classes are called abstractÐ Abstract methods are methods of an abstract class which are left unimplemented, so must be implemented in subclasses¥ draw is an example¥ OOP: Access control¥ Access controlÐ For encapsulation, it is a good idea to restrict access to certain attributes and methods from outside the classÐ Private members are only accessible from the classÕs own methodsÐ Protected members are accessible from the classÕs own methods, and methods defined in subclassesÐ Public members are accessible from outside the class¥ Access controlÐ The public interface of an object is how it interacts with other objects and the rest of the programÐ The protected interface of an object is what allows subclasses to change the way the base class behavesÐ The private members of an object are implementation details, hidden from the outside world¥ Access control in PythonÐ A field or method whose name begins with _ is protectedÐ A field or method whose name begins with _ _ is private¥ Names which begin and end with _ _ (like __init__) are special Ð donÕt use trailing underscores in your own namesÐ Everything else is public¥ Pedantic detailÐ Access control is merely a convention in Python¥ The interpreter wonÕt stop you from accessing protected members from outside the class or its subclasses, but PyCharm will warn you¥ Private members are Òname mangledÓ, but you can still access them if you know howÐ Almost all other languages enforce access control with compile-time errors¥ SummaryÐ OOP models three main types of real-world relationships¥ Is-a --> instantiation¥ Has-a --> composition¥ Is-a-type-of --> inheritanceÐ Inheritance allows polymorphism: different classes with the same public interfaceÐ Access control is an important tool in designing reusable, encapsulated objects
