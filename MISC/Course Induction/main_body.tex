\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	Welcome!
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	You are here because you have enrolled on one of the following courses:
	
	\vspace{0.2em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item BA(Hons) Game Development: Programming
		\item BSc(Hons) Computing for Games
		\item BSc(Hons) Immersive Computing
		\item BSc(Hons) Web Development
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	All of these courses have a common first-year focused on computing fundamentals and practical projects.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	The ACM define the `computing professional' as:
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	Someone belonging to a broad discipline that crosses the boundaries between mathematics, science, engineering, and business. They embody important professional competencies lying at the foundation of goal-oriented activities requiring, benefiting from, or creating computation. Computation being any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps following a	well-defined model, typically an algorithm.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	You are here because you want to become a \textbf{computing professional}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	The discipline consists of five sub-disciplines:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer Engineering
		\item Computer Science
		\item Information Systems
		\item Information Technology
		\item Software Engineering	
	\end{itemize}

	Roles such as \textit{games programmer} and \textit{web developer} usually draw on several of these sub-disciplines with different emphases.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Learning Outcomes}
	
	By the end of this session, you should be able to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Recognise who} your tutors are
		\item \textbf{Outline what} the Games Academy offers from a computing perspective
		\item \textbf{Explain} the career paths \textbf{and} key learning objectives that our computing courses cater to
		\item \textbf{Suggest} some of the kinds of question that excite game scholars within and around the computing discipline
		\item \textbf{Recall} the structure of the course
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Learning Outcomes}
	
	By the end of this session, you should be able to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Contrast} what is expected of students in the higher education context to the compulsory education context
		\item \textbf{Analyse how} to invest sufficient time in both course activities \textbf{as well as} self-regulated deliberate practice to achieve key goals
		\item \textbf{Recall} the role of the DoIT Profiler in identifying individual learning differences
	\end{itemize}

	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	It is important to note that:\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Digital media are complex and therefore require significant knowledge and skills to produce \pause
		\item They bring together art, storytelling, design and computing \pause
		\item Roles are therefore quite diverse and specialised \pause
		\item Each role requires very specific skills, mastered in considerable depth \pause
		\item In small indie studios, you might need to fill multiple roles, including business and design \pause
		\item Knowledge of effective team-working tactics is essential (though there are many ways of working)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	Computing professionals tend to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deal with the technical side of creative development \pause
		\item Be specialists, consultants, analysts, or technical leaders \pause
		\item Be people who are comfortable with mathematics and science \pause
		\item Keep up with the fast-paced field of computer technology \pause
		\item Straddle the arts and sciences, being able to draw together elements from both \pause
		\item Have expertise in software engineering and computer science, with an ability to conduct independent research
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	There is a wide range of technical roles in game studios:

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What About Other Careers?}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	\textbf{Design}: designers who can prototype and implement are in high demand, while the analytical and mathematical skills they apply help them to quickly improve their designs \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Illustrate or Compose}: art for digital games is indeed digital and technical artists are in high demand \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Manage}: insight into how software developers practice their craft will make you better at managing them in a studio context 
			(and perhaps even garner some respect) \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Administrate}: the games industry isn't just about development, there is a huge range of other career paths,
			such as human resources and IT

    Let's discuss what `expectations' means, with particular focus on how they differ between higher and compulsory education.
    
    \vspace{0.5em}

	\begin{itemize}
	    \item \textbf{List} key differences between expectations in the higher education and compulsory education contexts;
		\item \textbf{Suggest} what will be expected of you during your time on the course;
		\item 	\textbf{Give} examples of activities that count as `self-directed study'.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Expectations}
	
	Please note the following:
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a full-time course
		\item You are expected to do 1200 hours of study per academic year
		\item Approximately $1/3$ of that will be contact time
		\item Approximately $2/3$ of that will be `self-directed study'
		\item This means you are expected to study 40 hours per week, \textbf{EACH} week across the two 15-week study blocks
		\item If you can't commit to this---you will likely struggle with the pace of the course and the group work
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Expectation}
	
	Typically, study blocks have the following structure:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 5 Weeks - Sessions with Tutors
		\item 1 Week - Assessments and Self-Directed Studio Practice with Team
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{NOT} a vacation
		\end{itemize}
		\item 5 Weeks - Further Sessions with Tutors
		\item 1 Week - Assessments and Self-Directed Studio Practice with Team
		\item Vacation Period
		\item 1 Week - Assessments  and Self-Directed Studio Practice with Team
		\item 2 Weeks - Workshops Festival

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	\textbf{Question}: The critic draws a question card. 
		\item 	\textbf{Answer}: The \textit{remaining players} (i.e., not the critic!) submit their best game card, to answer the question, face-up.
		\item 	\textbf{Justification}: The \textit{remaining players} justify the game card they have selected.
		\item 	\textbf{Selection}: The critic selects the most suitable game card answering the question. That player `wins' the round, keeping the question card as a scoring token and becomes the next critic.	
		\item 	\textbf{Repeat} from step 1, for approximately 20 minutes.
