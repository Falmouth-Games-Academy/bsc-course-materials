\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	It is important to note that:\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Games are complex and therefore require significant knowledge and skills to produce \pause
		\item They bring together art, storytelling, design and computing \pause
		\item Roles are therefore quite diverse and specialised \pause
		\item Each role requires very specific skills, mastered in considerable depth \pause
		\item In small indie studios, you might need to fill multiple roles, including business and design \pause
		\item Knowledge of effective team-working tactics is essential (though there are many ways of working)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	Computing professionals tend to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deal with the technical side of games development \pause
		\item Be specialists, consultants, analysts, or technical leaders \pause
		\item Be people who are comfortable with mathematics and science \pause
		\item Keep up with the fast-paced field of computer technology \pause
		\item Have a science degree rather than an arts degree, but are nonetheless creative \pause
		\item Experts in programming and software engineering, with an ability to conduct independent research
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	There is a wide range of technical roles in game studios:
	
	\begin{columns}
		\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Technical Director / CTO / Lead
				\item Gameplay Programmer
				\item Engine Programmer
				\item Physics Programmer
				\item AI Programmer
				\item Network Programmer
				\item Graphics Programmer
			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}

			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What About Other Careers?}
	
	A computing degree isn't a tether. You can:  \pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	\textbf{Design}: designers who can prototype and implement are in high demand, while the analytical and mathematical skills they apply help them to quickly improve their designs \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Illustrate or Compose}: art for digital games is indeed digital and technical artists are in high demand \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Manage}: insight into how software developers practice their craft will make you better at managing them in a studio context 
			(and perhaps even garner some respect) \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Administrate}: the games industry isn't just about development, there is a huge range of other career paths,
			such as human resources and IT

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Games Meta-Game}
	
	Setup:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Self-organise into groups of 3-4 players
		\item You will each receive two sets of card: game cards and question cards.
		\item While you are waiting for your cards, identify the youngest player. They will be the first critic.
		\item All actions are clockwise from the critic.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Games Meta-Game}
	
	Instructions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	\textbf{Question}: The critic draws a question card. 
		\item 	\textbf{Answer}: The \textit{remaining players} (i.e., not the critic!) submit their best game card, to answer the question, face-up.
		\item 	\textbf{Justification}: The \textit{remaining players} justify the game card they have selected.
		\item 	\textbf{Selection}: The critic selects the most suitable game card answering the question. That player `wins' the round, keeping the question card as a scoring token
			and becomes the next critic.	
		\item 	\textbf{Repeat} from step 1, for approximately 20 minutes.

\part{Study Block 1}
\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\Large{COMP110: Principles of Computing}}
	
	This module is designed to introduce you to the basic principles of computing and programming in the context of digital games.
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	Your learning will complement the other modules through providing a broad foundation on the different methods and techniques which will help you to be able to construct computer programs and able to use relevant scholarly sources. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\Large{COMP120: Creative Computing --- Tinkering}}
	
	This module is designed to help you learn different ways of engaging with code using practical and exploratory methods. 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	You will learn the value of taking a creative approach to computing and become acquainted with some of the principles behind Creative Computing. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\Large{COMP150: Game Development Practice}}
	
	This module introduces you to the founding principles and processes of professional game development. 
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	You gain an understanding of the way that the different components of game development come together to make playable games and how those components are organised through the development pipeline. You also gain a `first-principles' understanding of how games are designed with a target market in mind and have a strong underlying concept.

\end{frame}

\part{Study Block 2}
\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\Large{COMP140: Creative Computing --- Codecraft}}
	
	The module allows you to further develop your creativity and a creative approach to computing within the context of digital games technology.
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	At first, you will complete worksheets to deepen your technical understanding and then apply that, as an individual, to your own open-source game \textit{and} game controller development project. You will collate disparate elements together, hardware and code from multiple sources, combining them via adaptation and integration. This will help you to learn ways and methods for technical exploration and synthesis in order to help you build more creative and robust programs. 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{\Large{COMP130: Architecture \& Engineering}}
	
	This module helps you to understand the ways in which software architecture and engineering practice can shape the types of computing solutions that one might build for games.
	
	\vspace{2em}
	
	You do this by building on your experience of practical game development, engaging in depth with more sophisticated and professional approaches within the context of a collaborative multidisciplinary project. You will learn the importance of clarity, reuse, scalability, and extensibility when sharing solutions with your team, applying design patterns and quality assurance to resolve common challenges.
