\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	Welcome!
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	You are here because you have enrolled on one of the following courses:
	
	\vspace{0.2em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item BA(Hons) Game Development: Programming
		\item BSc(Hons) Computing for Games
		\item BSc(Hons) Immersive Computing
		\item BSc(Hons) Computer Science
		\item BSc(Hons) Robotics
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	All of these courses have a common first-year focused on computing fundamentals and practical projects, and some have the option for a year of professional practice.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	The ACM define the `computing professional' as:
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	Someone belonging to a broad discipline that crosses the boundaries between mathematics, science, engineering, and business. They embody important professional competencies lying at the foundation of goal-oriented activities requiring, benefiting from, or creating computation. Computation being any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps following a	well-defined model, typically an algorithm.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	You are here because you want to become a \textbf{computing professional}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	The discipline consists of five sub-disciplines:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer Engineering
		\item Computer Science
		\item Information Systems
		\item Information Technology
		\item Software Engineering

	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	It is important to note that:\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Digital media are complex and therefore require significant knowledge and skills to produce \pause
		\item They bring together art, storytelling, design and computing \pause
		\item Roles are therefore quite diverse and specialised \pause
		\item Each role requires very specific skills, mastered in considerable depth \pause
		\item In small indie studios, you might need to fill multiple roles, including business and design \pause
		\item Knowledge of effective team-working tactics is essential (though there are many ways of working)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	Computing professionals tend to:

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Modules}
	
	You have three modules to complete in study block one. These are:
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item COMP110 Principles of Computing
		\item COMP120 Creative Computing
		\item GAM110 Development Principles
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	Students on BA(Hons) courses and who have no intention of switching can swap COMP110 Principles of Computing for GAM120 Reading Experiences. You will need to complete a module transfer form - we only recommend making the switch if you do \textbf{not} feel comfortable with mathematics.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Modules}
	
	There are more detailed module introductions, module welcome talks, module induction talks, and assignment briefs available for you to review on the LearningSpace.
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	These should be available to you on Monday, if they aren't available already.
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	We will briefly introduce these modules now, but you will need to watch the videos for further detail.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP110 Principles of Computing}
		
	\small{\textbf{Aim:} To enable you to apply basic computing and mathematical theory to solve practical problems.}
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Module Leader:} Dr Ed Powley}	
	
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
\footnotesize{On this module, you will learn the foundational principles of computing, discrete mathematics, and technical communication (e.g., notation, pseudocode, unified modelling language, etc.). You start the process of learning to use core concepts and methods from computer science to solve practical problems and leverage algorithms in your solutions. You will become acquainted in a practical way with the techniques and methods that help you to work through challenges effectively and efficiently to design, build, and annotate computing solutions with reference to relevant scholarly sources.}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP120 Creative Computing}
		
	\small{\textbf{Aim:} To develop your comfort using code and computational techniques to manipulate digital media.}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Module Leader:} Dr Michael Scott}	
	
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
\footnotesize{On this module, you will learn different ways of engaging with code through a practical exploration of media formats including text, image, and sound. Whilst you work in a variety of pair- and mob- programming formats, you will play, tinker, experiment with, and extend code that will convert artefacts that already exist into something new as a form of appropriation.  In doing so, you will embrace the principal of rapid iteration and work in a creative way.  Engaging with creative computing in this way means that you will not only become acquainted with programming at an introductory-level, but you will also exercise your creativity. However, working in such a manner and producing derivative works raises moral and legal questions that you will consider and frame within topics such as plagiarism, intellectual property law, licensing rights, as well as the maker and open-source movements.}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{GAM110 Development Principles}
		
	\small{\textbf{Aim:} To engage with the foundational processes of digital project development in a studio-centred context, as well as the culture it supports.}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Module Leader:} Terry Greer}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
\footnotesize{On this module, you gain an understanding of the basic principles, terminology, roles, and tools used in the development of digital products and services. Supervised studio practice directs your attention towards the different assets and software components that need to be drawn together to make a working digital product and how they are organised throughout the development pipeline. You will immerse yourself in a studio culture in which you apply ‘agile’ project management methods to facilitate practical development and use version control tools to manage your collaboration. You will also gain a ‘first-principles’ understanding of how to design with a target market in mind and maintain a strong underlying concept.}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{GAM120 Reading Experiences}
		
	\textit{Optional switch for BA(Hons)	 students}
		
		\vspace{0.2em}
		
	\small{\textbf{Aim:} To introduce you to the formal characteristics of digital experiences, and the theories and concepts that have been developed for their analysis.}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Module Leader:} Dr Jeff Howard}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
\footnotesize{In exploring ideas about games and the player experience, this module offers a foundational space to begin to think closely and carefully about the formal nature of digital experiences, their markets and the contexts of their production, the pleasures they offer and what it means to play them. The ideas engaged with are intended to inform and broaden your development practice on other modules. You receive foundational lectures and workshops on researching experiences and methods for doing so, as well as on academic research methods and essay writing. Seminars provide the space for debating the ideas and material encountered, lectures provide orientation and a one-on-one tutorial provides individual feedback on your progress.}

	\frametitle{Blended Learning}
		
	Many areas of our provision have improved due to online delivery methods. These include:
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Academic workshop delivery and worksheet tutorials in COMP110
		\item Mathematics lectures and support in COMP270
		\item R\&D support and dissertation supervision in COMP320/COMP360
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	Since module ratings improved year-on-year for these modules, we will continue to use and enhance online delivery methods where they make sense and where they assure continuity in the student journey and a high quality of provision.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Blended Learning}
		
	Many areas of our provision benefit from traditional delivery methods. These include:
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Programming and version control setup and support in COMP120
		\item Collaborative development practice in our labs and studios in GAM110
		\item Using specialist requipment in COMP140, ROB210, and VR220
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	We are no longer supportive of hybrid methods as these were clunkly to run, spread the support too thin, and diminished community building aspects of the course.
	
	These are studio-based courses and you are expected to convene with members of your team in-person in the studio as timetabled for studio practice.

	You will usually submit your work as:
	
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item a link to your \texttt{git} repository
	    \item \textit{or} a single \texttt{.pdf} file
	    \item \textit{or} a single \texttt{.zip} archive
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	 Please use the following convention:
	
	\begin{large}
		\begin{center}
			\textbf{module\_assignmentNumber\_studentID}
		\end{center}
	\end{large}
	
	For example:
	
	\begin{Large}
		\begin{center}
			\textbf{comp110\_1\_2011213}

	In the absence of extenuating circumstances (i.e., you are seriously ill and stuck in hospital):
	
	\begin{Large}
		\begin{center}
			\textbf{You MUST submit something \\ for EVERY assigned coursework task!}
		\end{center}
	\end{Large}
	
	In the eyes of university policy, not submitting anything is usually unrecoverable. Even if your work is unfinished, please submit something! Even submitting a blank piece of paper is better than not submitting anything! 
	
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
	If you forget to submit, there is a grace period of 5 working days after the deadline. If you fail, you get a second attempt. And, usually, a third attempt.

    Let's discuss what `expectations' means, with particular focus on how they differ between higher and compulsory education.
    
    \vspace{0.5em}

	\begin{itemize}
	    \item \textbf{List} key differences between expectations in the higher education and compulsory education contexts;
		\item \textbf{Suggest} what will be expected of you during your time on the course;
		\item 	\textbf{Give} examples of activities that count as `self-directed study'.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Expectations}
	
	Please note the following:
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a full-time course
		\item You are expected to do 1200 hours of study per academic year
		\item Approximately $1/3$ of that will be contact time
		\item Approximately $2/3$ of that will be `self-directed study'
		\item This is a full-time course---you are expected to study 40 hours per week, \textbf{EACH} week, across \textbf{EACH} study block
		\item If you can't commit to this---you will likely struggle with the pace of the course and the group work
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Expectation}
	
	Typically, this coming study block has the following structure:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 5 Weeks - Sessions with Tutors
		\item 1 Week - Assessments and Self-Directed Studio Practice with Team
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{NOT} a vacation
		\end{itemize}
		\item 5 Weeks - Further Sessions with Tutors
		\item 1 Week - Assessments and Self-Directed Studio Practice with Team
		\item Vacation Period
		\item 1 Week - Assessments  and Self-Directed Studio Practice with Team
		\item 2 Weeks - Workshops Festival
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{NOT} a vacation

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Breaking Out}
	
	Your programming tutor will have setup a Microsoft Teams `chat' with you so that you can engage with them. Please introduce yourself to them and introduce yourself to the other members of your tutor group. You will be meeting with them regularly throughout the COMP120 module. We have a few icebreaking activities for you to choose from and a few recommended activities
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item SpaceTeam icebreaker
		\item Games Meta-game icebreaker
		\item Time management advice
		\item DoIT Profiler
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Icebreaker: SpaceTeam}
	
	A cooperative shouting game for piloting a spaceship!
	
	Setup:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Download \url{https://spaceteam.ca/}
		\item If you don't have an Apple or Android mobile phone, use an emulator (e.g., BlueStacks)
		\item Share the room code to play together online!
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Icebreaker: Games Meta-Game}
	
	Setup:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Organise into your tutor groups of 4-6 players
		\item You will each receive two sets of card: game cards and question cards.
		\item While you are waiting for your cards, identify the youngest player. They will be the first critic.
		\item All actions are clockwise from the critic.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Icebreaker: Games Meta-Game}
	
	Instructions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	\textbf{Question}: The critic draws a question card. 
		\item 	\textbf{Answer}: The \textit{remaining players} (i.e., not the critic!) submit their best game card, to answer the question, face-up.
		\item 	\textbf{Justification}: The \textit{remaining players} justify the game card they have selected.
		\item 	\textbf{Selection}: The critic selects the most suitable game card answering the question. That player `wins' the round, keeping the question card as a scoring token and becomes the next critic.	
		\item 	\textbf{Repeat} from step 1, for approximately 20 minutes.	
	\end{enumerate}
