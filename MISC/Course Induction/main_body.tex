\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	Welcome!
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	You are here because you have enrolled on one of the following courses:
	
	\vspace{0.2em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item BA(Hons) Game Development: Programming
		\item BSc(Hons) Computer Science
		\item BSc(Hons) Computing for Games
		\item BSc(Hons) Data Science
		\item BSc(Hons) Immersive Computing
		\item BSc(Hons) Robotics
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	All of these courses have a common first-year focused on computing fundamentals and practical projects, and some have the option for a year of professional practice.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	The ACM define the `computing professional' as:
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	Someone belonging to a broad discipline that crosses the boundaries between mathematics, science, engineering, and business. They embody important professional competencies lying at the foundation of goal-oriented activities requiring, benefiting from, or creating computation. Computation being any type of calculation that includes both arithmetical and non-arithmetical steps following a well-defined model, typically an algorithm.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	You are here because you want to become a \textbf{computing professional}.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Computing Subject Area}
	
	The discipline consists of five sub-disciplines:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer Engineering
		\item Computer Science
		\item Information Systems
		\item Information Technology
		\item Software Engineering	
	\end{itemize}

	Roles such as \textit{games programmer}, \textit{web developer}, or \textit{roboticist} usually draw on several of these sub-disciplines with different emphases.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Learning Outcomes}

		\item \textbf{Explain} the career paths \textbf{and} key learning objectives that our computing courses cater to
		\item \textbf{Suggest} some of the kinds of question that excite scholars within and around the computing discipline
		\item \textbf{Recall} the structure of the course
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Learning Outcomes}
	
	By the end of this session, you should be able to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Contrast} what is expected of students in the higher education context to the compulsory education context
		\item \textbf{Reflect upon how} to invest sufficient time in both course activities \textbf{as well as} self-regulated deliberate practice to achieve key goals
		\item \textbf{Remember} to go to the DoIT Profiler session (\textit{next!}) to identify your individual learning differences

	It is important to note that:\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Digital media are complex and therefore require significant knowledge and skills to produce \pause
		\item They bring together art, storytelling, design and computing \pause
		\item Roles are therefore quite diverse and specialised \pause
		\item Each role requires very specific skills, mastered in considerable depth \pause
		\item In small indie studios, you might need to fill multiple roles, including business and design \pause
		\item Knowledge of effective team-working tactics is essential (though there are many ways of working)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers}
	
	Computing professionals tend to:

	\frametitle{Modules}
	
	Everyone does the same three modules in study block one. These are:
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item COMP101 Principles of Computing
		\item GAM101 Development Principles
		\item GAM102 Digital Creativity

	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	Numeracy is part of several modules in this first stage of the course, but the \bextbf{BA(Hons)} course will \bextbf{not} continue this into the second stage. We only recommend making the switch if you do \textbf{not} feel comfortable with mathematics by the end of the year.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Modules}
	
	There are more detailed module introductions, module welcome talks, module induction talks, and assignment briefs available for you to review on the LearningSpace.
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	These should be available to you next week, if they aren't available already.
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	We will briefly introduce these modules now, but you will need to review further details on LearningSpace.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{COMP101 Principles of Computing}
		
	\small{\textbf{Aim:} To help you solve practical problems using basic computing and mathematical theory.}
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Module Leader:} Associate Professor Ed Powley}	
	
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
\footnotesize{On this module, you will learn the principles of computing, discrete mathematics, statistics, and technical communication (e.g., notation, pseudocode, unified modelling language, etc.). You begin to use core concepts and methods from computer science to solve practical problems and leverage algorithms in your solutions. Particular attention will be drawn to the history of computing, referencing the plurality of voices in the profession and the controversies evoked by algorithmic bias. A series of worksheet tasks will acquaint you with the techniques and methods in a practical way, enabling you to responsibly design, build, and annotate computing solutions.}
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Assignment:} Worksheet Tasks}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{GAM101 Development Foundations}
		
	\small{\textbf{Aim:} To get you to practice the foundational collaborative skills required for the successful delivery of digital products and services.}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Module Leader:} Brian McDonald}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
\footnotesize{On this module, you will gain foundational experience of developing digital products and services in teams. You attain this practically through several small-scale projects following various prototyping and pitching methods. You will work to develop a studio culture that strives to uphold professional values such as integrity, inclusivity, respect, and generosity. You will also apply Agile management techniques to facilitate a healthy approach to scoping and time management to promote positive teamwork. All the while, reflective exercises will help you recognise key professional attributes.}

	\small{\textbf{Assignment:} Development Projects with Pitches}	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{GAM102 Digital Creativity}
		
	\small{\textbf{Aim:} To get you feeling more comfortable using digital tools and techniques in creative contexts.}
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\small{\textbf{Module Leader:} Associate Professor Michael Scott}	
	
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
\footnotesize{On this module, you will learn different ways of engaging with digital creativity through a practical exploration of digital media formats including text, image, and sound. You will play, tinker, experiment with, and extend digital artefacts. You will then integrate your digital artefacts with digital game technologies, notably game engines, to make them interactive in some way. In doing so, you will embrace the principles of rapid iteration and of how to use versioning systems. However, appropriating third-party materials raises moral and legal questions that you will consider and frame within topics such as plagiarism, intellectual property law, licensing rights, representation and media literacy, as well as the maker and open-source movements. }

	Enjoy freshers week now --- read them very carefully next week!
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	LearningSpace is also where you submit \textbf{ALL} final ``summative'' versions of your assigned coursework tasks! We use \texttt{git} repositories to manage the large size of digital projects.
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Assignments}
	
	You will usually submit your work as:
	
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item a link to your \texttt{git} repository
	    \item \textit{or} a single \texttt{.pdf} file
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	 Please use the following convention:
	
	\begin{large}
		\begin{center}
			\textbf{module-assignmentNumber-studentID}
		\end{center}
	\end{large}
	
	For example:
	
	\begin{Large}
		\begin{center}
			\textbf{comp101-1-2011213}
		\end{center}
	\end{Large}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	We use anonymous marking where possible.

	Take note of these carefully! A single second late, and your work will be capped at the minimum passing grade.

	In the absence of extenuating circumstances (i.e., you are seriously ill and stuck in hospital):
	
	\begin{Large}
		\begin{center}
			\textbf{You MUST submit something \\ for EVERY assigned coursework task!}
		\end{center}
	\end{Large}
	
	In the eyes of university policy, not submitting anything is usually unrecoverable. Even if your work is unfinished, please submit something! Even submitting a blank piece of paper is better than not submitting anything! 
	
		\vspace{0.5em}
	
	If you forget to submit, there is a grace period of 5 working days after the deadline. There is an EC policy which you can use to remove late submission penalties. 
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Extenuating Circumstances}
		
	There is an extenuating circumstances policy which can be used to grant long or short extentions:
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	\url{https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/sites/default/files/media/downloads/Extenuating\%20Circumstances\%20Policy\%20from\%2019\%20September\%202022_0.pdf}
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	Academic staff do not have any say over whether ECs are granted or refused! These are determined by an impartial team based on the evidence you submit. 
	
		\vspace{1em}
	
	Make contact with a student advisor if you need help with ECs. 
	
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Retrieval}
		
	If you fail an assignment, you get a second attempt. And, usually, a third attempt.
	
		\vspace{1em}
	
	The second attempt is usually a \textbf{synoptic} assessment that takes place over the summer months, and will usually be a new assignment that is different to the originally set brief.
	
		\vspace{1em}
	
	Third attempts are discretionary, and are usually `trailed' into the next stage of study.

    Let's discuss what `expectations' means, with particular focus on how they differ between higher and compulsory education.
    
    \vspace{0.5em}

	\begin{itemize}
	    \item \textbf{List} key differences between expectations in the higher education and compulsory education contexts;
		\item \textbf{Suggest} what will be expected of you during your time on the course;
		\item 	\textbf{Give} examples of activities that count as `self-directed study'.
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

	Please note the following:
	
	\vspace{0.5em}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This is a full-time course
		\item You are expected to do 1200 hours of study per academic year
		\item Approximately $1/3$ of that will be contact time
		\item Approximately $2/3$ of that will be `self-directed study'
		\item This is a full-time course---you are expected to study \textbf{40 hours per week}, \textbf{EACH} week, for \textbf{15 weeks} across \textbf{EACH} study block
		\item By virtue of enrolling you have made a committment to make this time available to study---your engagement with your studies is monitored
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Expectation}
	
	Typically, this coming study block has the following structure:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 Week - Induction

	\frametitle{Staff Support}
	
	You will receive support from staff during your timetabled sessions. However, if you require further assistance, for programming contact your programming tutor in the first instance, and for other academic queries, contact the relevant module leader. However, please be aware that educating you is only one part of our roles. We also do: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Research
		\item Scholarship
		\item Knowledge-Exchange
		\item Public Service and Outreach
		\item Consultation
		\item Pastoral Care
		\item Administration
		\item External examining
	\end{itemize}	
	
	Arrange ad-hoc support via email or Teams. We are not an on-demand service, but are happy to host you at our mutual convenience.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Later: Robot Olympics}
	
	Later this week we will hold the Programming Olympiad next week --- they're fun low-stakes activities.
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	 Look at COMP101 for preparation. 
	
	\vspace{1em}
	
	Your programming tutor will introduce you to your team at the start of the event. Please be mutually respectful  --- you will be meeting with these peers regularly across the study block.

%	A cooperative shouting game for piloting a spaceship!
	
%	Setup:
	
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Download \url{https://spaceteam.ca/}
%		\item If you don't have an Apple or Android mobile phone, use an emulator on a personal device (e.g., BlueStacks)
%		\item Share the room code with the people near you to play together online!
%	\end{itemize}
	
%\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}
%	\frametitle{Icebreaker: Games Meta-Game}
	
%	Setup:
	
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item Organise into your tutor groups of 4-6 players
%		\item You will each receive two sets of card: game cards and question cards.
%		\item While you are waiting for your cards, identify the youngest player. They will be the first critic.
%		\item All actions are clockwise from the critic.
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}
%	\frametitle{Icebreaker: Games Meta-Game}
	
%	Instructions:
	
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item 	\textbf{Question}: The critic draws a question card. 
%		\item 	\textbf{Answer}: The \textit{remaining players} (i.e., not the critic!) submit their best game card, to answer the question, face-up.
%		\item 	\textbf{Justification}: The \textit{remaining players} justify the game card they have selected.
%		\item 	\textbf{Selection}: The critic selects the most suitable game card answering the question. That player `wins' the round, keeping the question card as a scoring token and becomes the next critic.	
%		\item 	\textbf{Repeat} from step 1, for approximately 20 minutes.
