\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	It is important to note that:\pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Games are complex and therefore require significant knowledge and skills to produce \pause
		\item They bring together art, storytelling, design and computing \pause
		\item Roles are therefore quite diverse and specialised \pause
		\item Each role requires very specific skills, mastered in considerable depth \pause
		\item In small indie studios, you might need to fill multiple roles, including business and design \pause
		\item Knowledge of effective team-working tactics is essential (though there are many ways of working)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	Computing professionals tend to:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Deal with the technical side of games development \pause
		\item Be specialists, consultants, analysts, or technical leaders \pause
		\item Be people who are comfortable with mathematics and science \pause
		\item Keep up with the fast-paced field of computer technology \pause
		\item Have a science degree rather than an arts degree, but are nonetheless creative \pause
		\item Experts in programming and software engineering, with an ability to conduct independent research
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Careers for Computing Professionals}
	
	There is a wide range of technical roles in game studios:
	
	\begin{columns}
		\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Technical Director / CTO / Lead
				\item Gameplay Programmer
				\item Engine Programmer
				\item Physics Programmer
				\item AI Programmer
				\item Network Programmer
				\item Graphics Programmer
			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}
		\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Tools Programmer
				\item UX / UI Programmer
				\item Middleware / Technology Developer
				\item Porting Programmer
				\item Level Scripter
				\item Audio Engineer
				\item Data Scientist
			\end{itemize}
		\end{column}
	\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{What About Other Careers?}
	
	A computing degree isn't a tether. You can:  \pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	\textbf{Design}: designers who can prototype and implement are in high demand, while the analytical and mathematical skills they apply help them to quickly improve their designs \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Illustrate or Compose}: art for digital games is indeed digital and technical artists are in high demand \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Manage}: insight into how software developers practice their craft will make you better at managing them in a studio context 
			(and perhaps even garner some respect) \pause
		\item 	\textbf{Administrate}: the games industry isn't just about development, there is a huge range of other career paths,
			such as human resources and IT
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\part{The Meta-Game}
\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Games Meta-Game}
	
	Setup:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Self-organise into groups of 3-4 players
		\item You will each receive two sets of card: game cards and question cards.
		\item While you are waiting for your cards, identify the youngest player. They will be the first critic.
		\item All actions are clockwise from the critic.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Games Meta-Game}
	
	Instructions:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	\textbf{Question}: The critic draws a question card. 
		\item 	\textbf{Answer}: The \textit{remaining players} (i.e., not the critic!) submit their best game card, to answer the question, face-up.
		\item 	\textbf{Justification}: The \textit{remaining players} justify the game card they have selected.
		\item 	\textbf{Selection}: The critic selects the most suitable game card answering the question. That player `wins' the round, keeping the question card as a scoring token
			and becomes the next critic.	
		\item 	\textbf{Repeat} from step 1, for approximately 20 minutes.	
	\end{enumerate}

	Within the whole university, out of 51 courses, Computing for Games is: \pause
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{\#1} for Assessment \& Feedback \pause
		\item \textbf{\#2} for Learning Opportunities \pause
		\item \textbf{\#2} for Learning Community \pause
		\item \textbf{\#3} [tied] for Student Satisfaction \pause
		\begin{itemize}
			\item I want the course to be \textbf{\#1} so please engage with us and your student reps! \pause
		\end{itemize}
		\item Over 80\% of the modules we offer are in the top-10\% of all modules Falmouth offers, as rated by student evaluations  \pause
		\begin{itemize}
			\item COMP250: Artificial Intelligence in top-1\% \pause
		\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Philosophy}
	
	We are the only science degree in the Game Academy and do things a little differently:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Emphasis on developing community, and discourse/peer-review within that community
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Do it together and learn from each other, before doing it alone
			\item Critique each others' work and discuss what constitutes good practice
		\end{itemize}
		\pause\item Emphasis on feed-forward over just feed-back
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Early milestones, earlier start, more learning
			\item Get advice on how to improve your own practice \textit{before} you submit your work
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Philosophy}
	
	We are the only science degree in the entire university and do things a little differently:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Emphasis on highly structured assignments 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Formative work across the study block
			\item Guaranteed 40\% pass for successfully completing all in-class activities with basic competence and submitting on-time
			\item Face-to-face feedback and discussion			
		\end{itemize}
		\pause\item Emphasis on continuing personal development
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Personal growth over hitting a benchmark
			\item Journey to professional competency and beyond, rather than hitting a grade
			\item Rubrics and qualitative feedback (at least, at first)			
		\end{itemize}
