	\begin{itemize}
		\item Self-organise into groups of 3-4
		\item Take a MetaGame card (for a game you have all heard of)
		\item Imagine \textbf{adding PCG} to this game
			\begin{itemize}
				\item What \textbf{type of PCG} would enhance the game?
				\item What other \textbf{changes to mechanics} would be needed to rebalance the game?
				\item Would PCG change the \textbf{aesthetics} of the game?
				\item Would PCG change the \textbf{target audience} of the game, or how the game is \textbf{marketed}?
			\end{itemize}
		\item If the game \textbf{already} has PCG, imagine \textbf{removing} it instead
	\end{itemize}
