\frame{\partpage}

\begin{frame}{A rhetorical question}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Suppose you could put your game in front of \textbf{thousands of players}
		\pause\item You can alter your game's code to \textbf{measure} things about how players play
			and \textbf{report} them back to you
		\pause\item What \textbf{questions} could you answer about your game?
		\pause\item How could these answers make your game more \textbf{enjoyable} and/or \textbf{profitable}?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Analytics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Analytics is the analysis of \textbf{data} to discover \textbf{patterns}
		\pause\item Related terms: data mining, data science, big data, ...
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why analytics?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Most of our gaming devices nowadays have \textbf{always-on internet connections}
		\pause\item Developers can easily push \textbf{updates} to released games
		\pause\item Games can easily \textbf{collect data} and send it back to developers
		\pause\item Bandwidth, storage, compute time are \textbf{cheap}
		\pause\item Analytics can take the \textbf{guesswork} out of many game design and business decisions
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Feedback loops}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Game development is a \textbf{feedback loop} of \textbf{playtesting} and \textbf{iteration}
		\pause\item Gathering and interpreting informal feedback from playtesters is \textbf{hard}
		\pause\item ... and even harder when your ``playtesters'' are your \textbf{customers}
		\pause\item Analytics aims to turn this process into more of a \textbf{science}
		\pause\item The \textbf{build-measure-learn} cycle
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
