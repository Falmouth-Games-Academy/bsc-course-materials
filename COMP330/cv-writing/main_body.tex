	\frametitle{Activity: Slay the Virtual Dragons}
	\small{
	You can spend hours agonising over your professional profile, locking in every pixel of your personal portfolio site, auditing all your projects so they look their best, and creating an overall picture of passion and love for the games industry. You can meticulously sculpt the CV so it is brimming with the relevant experience, skills, and qualifications that culminate to produce an indisputable case for employability. All of this can come crumbling down in seconds if you are not careful about how your online presence portrays you as an individual.  \\~\\
	}

\small{
For this task, stalk the world in which the virtual-you inhabits. Leave no stone unturned and no server resource unrequested. Look for virtual dragons; that is, the weird things about yourself that you had no idea were available to the general public. Collect tales of dragons to share amongst your peers. Who can find and slay the biggest dragon? }

	\frametitle{Activity: Alignment}
	\small{
Sometimes, writing your CV can feel quite daunting. It is hard to know whether what you write aligns with what future employers are looking for. One way of ensuring that you are at least on the right track is to compare your CV with job opportunities that are currently being advertised. \\~\\
For this task, find three advertised career opportunities that align with your career aspirations. The key word here is 'opportunities'. You don't have to just find job opportunities, it could be funding, further studies and so on. Once you have selected three, cross reference your CV with the requirements provided by the advertised opportunity.  \\~\\
 } 
\end{frame}
	
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Suggested Process: }
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Make three copies of your CV (One for each opportunity)
		\item Add notes directly on to the CV 
		\item Save and add to the assignment repo.
	\end{itemize}

You can do this using the review system built into Microsoft word or by saving the CV as a PDF and then using the comments system included in must PDF readers.
