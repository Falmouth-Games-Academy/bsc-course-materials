\maketitle

Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a way of communicating the design of software using diagrams. It is a notation that built upon the work of Grady Booch, James Rumbaugh, Ivar Jacobson, and the Rational Software Corporation. It was originally developed to support the object-oriented paradigm, although has since been extended to accommodate a diverse range of projects. According to the Object Management Group (OMG), UML is the international standard for software modelling.

\section{In-Class Task}

In today's in-class task you will learn how to draw \textbf{UML Sequence} and \textbf{UML Interaction Overview} diagrams. To complete this you will:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Organise} yourselves into your COMP130 project teams.
	\item \textbf{Watch} the video tutorial at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxG-qWthxt4}.
	\item \textbf{Read} \url{http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/sequenceDiagram.htm}.
	\item \textbf{Draw} a UML Sequence diagram to model ONE component (e.g. sprite control).
	\item \textbf{Watch} the video tutorial at \url{https://www.youtube.com/v/CJUc2crmrMs?version=3\&start=108\&end=163\&autoplay=1}.
	\item \textbf{Read} \url{http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/interactionOverviewDiagram.htm}.
	\item \textbf{Draw} a UML Interaction Overview diagram to model your main loop.
\end{itemize}
