\begin{frame}{Indices and Rendering}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Indices are integers which specify the vertices that make up a mesh
		\pause\item In rendering this allows us to send less data to the pipeline
		\pause\item A cube would have 36 vertices, this will be at least 432 bytes (12 bytes per vertex)
		\pause\item With indices, we used 8 vertices and 36 indices, which is around 240 bytes in total.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Index Buffer}
\begin{itemize}
	\item These indices are stored in what is know as a Index Buffer(Directx) or Element Buffer(OpenGL)
	\pause \item In OpenGL and Directx, we fill these up and tell the pipeline what Buffer to use
	\pause \item In UE4 and Unity, these buffers are usually hidden away from us
	\pause \item We typically use higher level classes such as C\# Mesh and UE4 Procedural Mesh to add in our own indices 
\end{itemize}
