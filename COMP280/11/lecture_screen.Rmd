## Learning Outcomes 
After this session you will be able to:

- **Explain** what is meant by the term human-computer interaction (HCI)
- **Discuss** how HCI has changed over the years
- **Outline** some basic HCI principles as described by Don Norman in his book, The Design of Everyday Things  

## Worksheet 4

## Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)
> "If we didn't have people, everything would work so much better" - **Donald A. Norman**

## HCI is.. 

the study of the relationship between people and technology

}
```
		
## A Little Bit of History
	
- Commonly understood that HCI formally acknowledged as a field of study in 1982
- driven by the shift from secure cool room computers to personal computer - Apple 2 IBM PC Commodore
- In essence, non-engineers having access to computers
- Early computers were pretty daunting to non-engineers
- HCI was born from the shift from specialist users to day-to-day use by non-engineers

```

	
## More recently...

Early 90s HCI blew up as the internet and web went mainstream and there was an explosion of new interface and communication methods

**Other Notable Shifts:**
	
- Fixed computers 2004 -  portable devices
- Authored content 2004 - user generated content
- personal portable screens - wearables and HMDs


## Buzzword Bingo!

- Mobile
- Multitouch
- Gestures and natural computing
- Sensors
- Embedded
- Wearables
- Sustainability
- Big Data
- Social computing
- Accessibility
- Mixed Reality

## -
Lets begin with the principle that all artificial things are designed. 
	
Who is doing the designing?
	
# Are you doing any design? 

## HCI - A Crash Course}

Generally, HCI research is empirical. 


> "Relying on or derived from observation of experiment" - American Heritage Dictionary

## **Do not...** 

- Presume prior knowledge of the audience
- Especially, if they are a similar demographic to you
- Expect people to read the instructions
- Blame the user for errors
- Get frustrated with the user for unpredictable behaviour

## HCI is complex because...

- Borrow methods from other fields
- Create standards derived from other fields
- Involves Humans

# If HCI is the study of the relationship between people and technology what fields might that span?

## - 

- Computer Science (duh)
- Sociology
- Psychology
- Communication
- Human factors engineering
- Industrial engineering
- rehabilitation engineering
- and many more.

## HCI Research

> "HCI research requires both rigorous methods and relevance" **Donald A. Norman** 

We use it to influence interface design, development process, user training, and public policy. 
Generally, to improve our relationship with computers.

## What can be considered HCI contributions?

- Empirical
- Artefact
- Methodological
- Dataset
- Survey	
- Opinion
- theoretical

## These are Exciting Times

- Tools are much better now
- Eye tracking, sensors (EMG EEG)
- Access to the masses - mechanical Turk, social networks, large amounts of generated content to analyse
- Automation - AI machine learning, neural networks

## Affordances

> "the relationship between a physical object and a person" 

animal, human, robot...

- Standard Affordances - the real deal
- Perceivable Affordances - not really there (great for games)
- Anti-Affordances - designed to reduce affordances

## Signifiers

> "Communicate where the action should take place"

- also, hint towards what type of affordances there are (linked to mental models)
- The focus of designers
- Important for usability and accessibility
	
## Mappings
> "There is no need to understand the underlying physics or chemistry of each device we own, just the relationship between the controls and the outcomes"

## Conceptual models

- "People may hold different models of the same item"
- Models don't have to be, "complete or even accurate as long as they are useful"

What models can we think of? (padlocks on computer screens)

## UI Design Tips 

- Alignment
- Alignment
- Alignment

The placement of elements such that the edges line up along common rows or columns. or their bodies along a common center. 

> "Visual acuity is the ability to resolve details" (Jason Jerald)


- In ideal conditions a human can resolve details as small as 1/7200th of a degree 

## UI Design Tips 

**Consistency** 
"The usability of a system is improved when similar parts are expressed in similar ways" 


**Legibility** 
The visual clarity of text, generally based size, typeface and contrast with the background. 


**Scaling Fallacy** 
A tendency to assume that a system that works at one scale will also work at a smaller or larger scale

## Composition

**Rule of Thirds** 
The alignment of content based on invisible guides that divide the layout into thiids both on the vertical and horizontal plane



## Some useful UI laws

**Fitts' Law** 
The time required to move to a target is a function of the target size and distance to the target.

**Hick's Law** 
The time it takes to make a decision increases as the number of alternatives increases
