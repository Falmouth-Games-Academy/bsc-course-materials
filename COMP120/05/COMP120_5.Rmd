- **Check** code and comments using linters


## Code Review

![](assets/funny.png)\


>"Peer review—an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverable
examine it for defects and improvement opportunities—is one of the most powerful software
quality tools available." 

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)

## What to review 
- Any size project can benefit from code review.
- Avoid 'Not applicable here' (NAH) Syndrome
- 200 Line of code and hour (once familiar with code reviews)

## Difficulties

- pressure on both reviewer and reviewee 
- Lack of understanding
- Not instinctive behavior
- Set aside your ego and pride
- Accepting critique (Don't take it personally
- Misunderstood as time consuming
- Busy practitioners

## Benefits

- Shortened product development cycle time
- Less time spent performing rework
- Increased group programming productivity
- Better techniques learned from other developers* 
- Team cohesion
- Exchanging of information about components and overall system with other team members
- Better quality code base

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)

## Egoless Programming
A term first coined in 1971 by Gerald Weinberg - The Psychology of Computer Programming

> “egoless programming,” not “egoless programmer.” Developers
need a robust enough ego to trust and defend their work, but not so much ego that they reject
suggestions for better solutions. Similarly, the egoless reviewer should have compassion and
sensitivity for his colleagues, if only because their roles will be reversed one day.

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)

## Tips for reviewee
- RESPECT
- be receptive
- Reciprocate don't retaliate 


## Tips for reviewer
- RESPECT
- Avoid accusatory language
- Discuss the work not the author
- Be constructive with your criticism
- "Bugs are the bad guy" - Wiegers
- Identify the good as well as the bad

## Planning a Review
Allocate resources 


## How




## Pythonic Code



## Some helpful talking points 
```
>import this
```
\tiny

```{python, echo=FALSE}
import this
```

## Potential Issues: General
- Does the code follow the teams prefered paradigms
- 


## Potential Issues: Look and Feel
Did the author show respect for their code

- Indentations
- Redundant code - delete it don't comment it out
- Blank lines
- General Tidyness

## Readability
- Names reflect their purpose
- Comments are used appropriately
- 


## Potential Issues: Variables
- Consistent naming conventions
- Redundant vars
- aRE 

## Potential Issues: Adherence to Style and Standards
- PEP8
- PEP257


## PEP8 Linting 
```
pip3 install pycodestyle
pycodestyle filename.py
```

- **--statistics** how often each error was found      
- **--show-source** shows the source where error occurs
- **--show-pep8** pulls in the PEP8 text for error


## PEP 257 Docstrings
[View Docs]() 

Checking Docstrings

```
pip install pep257

```

## Review Your Way to Success

> "If you’re serious about the quality of your work, you’ll accept that you make mistakes,
seek the counsel of your compatriots in finding them, and willingly review your colleagues’
work products. You will set aside your ego so you can benefit from the experience and
perspective of your technical associates. When you have internalized the benefits of peer
reviews, you won’t feel comfortable unless someone else carefully examines any significant
deliverable you create."

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)
