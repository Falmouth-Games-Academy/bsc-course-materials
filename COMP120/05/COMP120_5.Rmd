## Register Attendance
![Attendance monitoring is in place. It is your responsability to ensure that you have signed yourself in.](assets/attendance.png)

## Learning Outcomes 
After this session you will be able to:

- **Write** maintainable & readable code 
- **Execute** a code review 
- **Check** code and comments using linters


## Code Review

![](assets/funny.png)\


>"Peer review—an activity in which people other than the author of a software deliverable
examine it for defects and improvement opportunities—is one of the most powerful software
quality tools available." 

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)

## What to review 
- Avoid 'Not applicable here' (NAH) Syndrome
- Any size project can benefit from code review
- Review no more than 400 lines at a time
- 200 Line of code and hour (once familiar with code reviews)

## Difficulties
- Pressure on both reviewer and reviewee 
- Not instinctive behavior
- Honesty
- Fear of offending 
- Set aside your ego and pride
- Accepting critique (Don't take it personally
- Misunderstood as time consuming
- Too busy

## Benefits
- Shortened product development cycle time
- Less time spent performing rework
- Increased group programming productivity
- Better techniques learned from other developers* 
- Team cohesion
- Exchanging of information about components and overall system with other team members
- Better quality code base

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)

## Egoless Programming
A term first coined in 1971 by Gerald Weinberg - The Psychology of Computer Programming

> “egoless programming,” not “egoless programmer.” Developers
need a robust enough ego to trust and defend their work, but not so much ego that they reject
suggestions for better solutions. Similarly, the egoless reviewer should have compassion and
sensitivity for his colleagues, if only because their roles will be reversed one day.

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)

## Tips for reviewee
- Strive for quality
- RESPECT
- be receptive
- Reciprocate don't retaliate 


## Tips for reviewer
- RESPECT
- Avoid accusatory language
- Discuss the work not the author
- Be constructive with your criticism
- "Bugs are the bad guy" - Wiegers
- Identify the good as well as the bad

## Planning a Review
- Allocate resources 
- Create a check list

## Some helpful talking points

\tiny

```{python, echo=FALSE}
import this
```

## Potential Issues: General
- Does it work?
- Does the code follow the teams prefered paradigms
- Otimisation 

## Potential Issues: Look and Feel
Did the author show respect for their code

- Repetition
- Shy code - loosely coupled (Pragmatic Programmer)
- Indentations
- Redundant code - delete it don't comment it out
- Blank lines
- Debuging code removed
- General Tidyness

## Readability
- Consitent nameing conventions
- Names reflect their purpose (variables, functions, classes...)
- Comments are consistent and appropriate
- Easy to follow the flow
- line lengths (79 chars ish)

## Potential Issues: Variables
- Consistent naming conventions
- Redundant variables
- Subtle bugs - wrong variables used
- limit global vars (none if possible)

## Potential Issues: Unforseen 
- Security issues
- Blockers further down the road
- Integration issues

## Potential Issues: Adherence to Style and Standards
- PEP8: Standard Python style guide
- PEP257: Docstrings
- Linting for all the things... 

## PEP8 Linting 
```
pip3 install pycodestyle
pycodestyle filename.py
```

- **--statistics** how often each error was found      
- **--show-source** shows the source where error occurs
- **--show-pep8** pulls in the PEP8 text for error


## PEP 257 Docstrings
[View Docs]() 

Checking Docstrings

```
pip install pep257
pep257 PetPEP257.py
```

## Review Your Way to Success

> "If you’re serious about the quality of your work, you’ll accept that you make mistakes,
seek the counsel of your compatriots in finding them, and willingly review your colleagues’
work products. You will set aside your ego so you can benefit from the experience and
perspective of your technical associates. When you have internalized the benefits of peer
reviews, you won’t feel comfortable unless someone else carefully examines any significant
deliverable you create."

[Karl E. Wiegers - Humanizing Peer Reviews, 2002](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.pdf)
