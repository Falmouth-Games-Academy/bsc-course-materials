		\textbf{Quick Definition:} A wave of compression and refraction in an elastic medium, such as air, which can be detected by an animal’s sense of hearing

\begin{frame}{What is Sound?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause\item Many animals are able to sense sound in two key ways:
		\textbf{volume} and \textbf{pitch}.
		\pause\item\textbf{Volume:} The intensity of the change in pressure, as signified by the
		amplitude of a wave
		\pause\item\textbf{Pitch:} The frequency of the change, as signified by the length of
		the wave and its velocity (i.e., “the speed of sound”)
	\end{itemize}
