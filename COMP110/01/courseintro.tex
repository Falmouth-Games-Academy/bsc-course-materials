\begin{frame}{Aim}
\begin{center}
To enable you to apply basic computing and mathematical theory to practical programming activities.
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Description}
On this module, you will learn the basic principles of computing, discrete mathematics, and technical notation (e.g. pseudocode, UML, etc.). You start the process of learning to use basic methods and core concepts to solve practical problems and leverage algorithms in your solutions. You will become acquainted in a practical way with the techniques and methods that help you to work effectively and efficiently to build and annotate computing solutions with reference to relevant scholarly sources. You acquire experience of working on basic computing problems and solving them.
