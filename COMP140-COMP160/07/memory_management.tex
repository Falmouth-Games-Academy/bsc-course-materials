\begin{frame}{Garbage Collection in C\#}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item In C\# there is an inbuilt Garbage Collector which will  walk through the Object Graph
		\pause \item It will check to see if the object is still allocated, if not, the Garbage Collector will cleanup the object
		\pause \item This process is automatic and is tuned for maximum performance

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Memory Management in C++}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item In C++ there is no Garbage Collection, you have to manually delete objects when no longer needed
		\pause \item Worth repeating  \textbf{for every new, you need a matching delete}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Memory - General Good Practices}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item Never allocate or deallocate during game update (this includes Instantiate)
		\pause \item Use Memory Pools to recycle objects

		\end{itemize}  
		\pause \item Cache frequently used objects
